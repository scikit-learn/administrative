# March 2021 29th

### Need decision
- SLEP006 after the first [vote](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/52) - [#16079](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16079)
    - Thomas raised the concern of having one method for all the parameters vs individual methods for each param (becomes a problem for estimators with many fit parameters)
    - **Suggestion**: one method for all meta data
        - `request_fit_parameters`
    - Andy raises the point that for non sample-aligned fit parameters we could try to avoid
        - However, this fails because we cannot route the corresponding argument
    - (Joel) Consider a few more cases in the SLEP and matching an implementation that can be tested
        - Make sure that there are people on board to test drive the SLEP and review

### Need attention (review)

- (Thomas) Infrequent categories for one hot encoder [#16018](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16018)
    - Joel approxed it, it needs a review
    - Concern: complexity of the one hot encoder
- (Thomas) Supporting `drop!=None` and `handle_unknown='ignore'` [#19041](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19041)
    - One approval
- (Christian) [#19705](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/19705) Minimal Scipy Version = 1.0.0
    - We need someone to tackle a rewamp of the CI to bump the minimal dependencies to that of the latest ubuntu LTS (probably from conda forge)
        - TODO: Add an issue and call for volonteer
- (Christian) [#19088](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19088) Loss function module
    - Very reviewable :)
- (Jeremie) [#17622](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17622) MiniBatchKMeans refactoring: convergence criterion fixes + CPU and memory performance improvements


### General topics
- (Christian) Scipy started to put [upper bounds on versions of dependencies](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/12862)
    - We can revisit this later
    - Given that Python versions create naturally forms of "silos" of dependencies, the problems are unlikely
- (Christian) [#9978](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/9978) Linear quantile regression `QuantileRegressor` uses `scipy.optimize.linprog`. How to specify the argument `solver`?
  1. There are different options depending on the version of scipy.
  2. In the future, there could be another solver that does not depend on `linprog`
      - Suggestion:
          - 1. Use as a default for a solver what is available in scikit-learn 1.0
          - 2. Have an option to use the more recent solver which raises an error if the scipy version is not high enough
- (Christian) API for regressors.
  - `linear_model` has one model per loss/objective (`LinearRegression`, `Ridge`, `LASSO`, `ElasticNet`, `PoissonRegressor`, `GammaRegressor`, ... `QuantileRegressor` with [#9978](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/9978))
  - `ensemble` and `tree` have one regression class (per estimator type) that let's you specify different losses (`GradientBoostingRegressor(loss="quantile", alpha=0.9)`, `HistGradientBoostingRegressor(loss="poisson")`)
      - Add an FAQ entry for that
- (Christian) Remove *experimental* from HGBT with scikit-learn version 1.0.0?
    - Yes
- (Olivier) `n_features_in_` [#19333](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/19333) and meta-estimators:
    - CalibratedClassifierCV: [#19555](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19555) ready for another review
    - New common test for meta-estimators to always delegate input validation and accept non-tabular pipelines as base estimators: [#19755](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19755) ready for review and will need sub-PRs to remove meta-estimators from the skiplist


### Contributors
- (jasperroebroek) [#19754](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19754) implementation of quantile regression forests
    - Currently it is a modification of the random forest. It needs Cythonization
    - The trick of the quantile forest computes the quantile predictions at predict time
        - The question is: how to set the quantile at predict time (given that the predictor can output conditional quantiles for multiple quantiles)
        - Proposed solutions (hacks): add a constructor parameter that specifies this quantile and can be a list

**Next meeting** Apr 26th
