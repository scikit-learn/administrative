### Updates

### Topics

- [name=Loïc] social media: Following Reshama's email, there seems to be a consensus for option c).
  - [name=Reshama] submit the PR to remove the link from the website + `README.md` + blog
  - [name=Olivier] posts the status update
  - [name=Gael]: will update GitHub dashboard: https://github.com/scikit-learn/administrative/issues/65

- [name=Olivier] Google Search Console access (I cant grant access to others)
    - `robots.txt` indexing of scikit-learn.org `/old_version` over `/stable`. https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/8958#issuecomment-2601856199. [name=Loïc] is planning to check the website statistics in a few weeks and see if they are going in the right direction.
    - maybe investigate use of canoncial URL in the HTML header. Make sure old versions point to the `/stable` version(?).

### Need attention/decision

- [name=Christian] Poisson loss for MLPRegressor [#30712](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30712)
We say that NN won't get new features, yet I think having the three most important losses (log loss, squared error, Poisson deviance) in all major supervised learning methods (linear, tree, nn) would complete the picture.
    - there is a difference between adding new features and maintaining MLP in good working order which includes making it uniform with the rest of the library. For example:
        - completing the set of popular losses (Poisson, Gamma, Tweedie, Pinball)
        - completing array API support
        - completing metadata routing
    - There seems to be consensus on those 3 points, but not more (alternative would be to deprecate and remove nn)

- [name=Gael] (if we have time, adding this to the bottom)
    - Where does the "sponsor" button on GitHub go to? Where should it go it? Answer: These are the GitHub Sponsors payouts: https://opencollective.com/scikit-learn/transactions?searchTerm=github
    - [name=Reshama] can update the YML file for this
        - Resolution: both open collective and github as targets, the money goes in the same place
        - Let's open an issue to agree on the phrasing of the paragraph of the sponsoring page on github: https://github.com/sponsors/scikit-learn
