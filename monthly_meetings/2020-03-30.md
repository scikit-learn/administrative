## May Release

We have enough to ship. And need to include:

- kwarg only PRs need reviews (they're easy to review)

- Let's please be done with https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16622 (`is_supervised_tag`) and not wait the last minute

We need add things we need to have in the release to the
milestone. Then focus on the [milestone](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/milestone/35)
and make sure there aren't bugs waiting for easy fixes.

- SH still open for reviews if you have time https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/13900

- Also top-k accuracy https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16625/ should be easy to review

- SLEP 014 [Array-out usage / API notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/thomasjpfan/sklearn_slep_014/blob/0.0.2/usage.ipynb) 

- Pretty HTML repr of estimators & pipeline in jupyter notebooks https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/14180 [usage notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/thomasjpfan/sklearn_viz_html/blob/master/display_estimator_workflow.ipynb)

- non-optional parameters to `fit` in `check_estimator` [16756](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/16756)
    - we're open to the idea. We need to figure the API
    - goal is to allow each estimator or `check_estimator` call to register a specific data generator
    - we also need to have a non-strict mode which checks
      only if the model can be used in a pipeline, gridsearch etc
    - Related: non-strict mode for check_estimators [13969](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/13969)

- Adrin's taking over the gower similarity PR
- Adrin and Joel had a call about sample props, which is moving forward

- MyPy checks: [16726](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16726)


## Next call
