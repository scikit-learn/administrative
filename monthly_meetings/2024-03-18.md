# scikit-learn & co bi-weekly meeting

## March 18th, 2024 3pm CET, 9am ET

### Progress reports

- [name=Loïc]
  + meson as main build backend [#28506](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28506).
    pyproject.toml changes needed for the wheels need to be reviewed. Tested conda-forge
    in https://github.com/conda-forge/scikit-learn-feedstock/pull/250.
  + conda-lock update: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28653

- [name=Olivier]
    - Triaging duty this week.
    - Array API reviews:
        - array-api-strict [#28555](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28555)
          ready for second review
        - train_test_split [#28407](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28407)
          ready for second review
        - ridge [#27800](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27800)
          first review
        - label binarizer [#28626](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28626)
          work in progress
            - needed for RidgeClassifierCV
              [#27961](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27961)
            - strategy accept Array API namespace but continue building a scipy
              sparse datastructure with numpy components before final conversion to
              Array API container to keept the code minimally changed
            - alternative would be to implement the code directly for dense allocated
              structure using Array API directly but not sure it's worth the extra code
              branch
    - Had a look at Thomas prototype for a cirun config to run CUDA tests in
      [#24491](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/24491#issuecomment-1999663173)
        - Security concerns should be cleared w.r.t. VM isolation
        - Still questions about the proper dispatch mechanism to use to allow
          maintainers to trigger the CI on external contributors' PRs.
    - Started to have a look at scipy's BSpline NaN handling to simplify the code to
      change to add missing value support to `SplineTransformer`
      [#28043](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28043)
        - need to write a minimal reproducer to discuss the issue with upstream (but
          paused because of triaging duty)
        - we can proceed with more complex code in scikit-learn code otherwise.

- [name=Stefanie]
    - nan support for SplineTransformer
      [#28043](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28043): restructure
      (missingness indicator computed lazily) and computing bsplines of sparse arrays
      with workaround
    - UnsetMetadataPassedError
      [#28517](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28517): parent param
      doesn‘t need to be passed
    - learning:
        - 1) concurrent and parallel programming
        - 2) serialization

- [name=Jérémie] (was off last week)
    - review and finalized some old but almost ready PRs.
      - currently on this one (allow string input in `pairwise_distances`). Discussed
        with guillaume for the final details but almost ready.
        https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27456
    - still cleaning-up `utils.__init__`. Only a few utils left.
    - Read about averaging ROC curves for Guillaume's PR
      https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25939 (ROC curve display from cv
      results) "On Averaging ROC Curves", Jack Hogan, Niall M. Adams,
      https://openreview.net/forum?id=FByH3qL87G
      https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25939

- [name=Arturo]
    - Description of `l2_regularization` in docstrings and user guide
      [#28652](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28652)
    - Mooc reviews

- [name=Guillaume]
    - Triaging issues and PRs
        - fixing CIs: [#28636](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28636)
        - closing a couple of old PRs
        - give feedback on newly open one
    - Discussion regarding `skrub` design

- [name=Jérôme]
    - mostly skrub
        - pipeline (recipe) builder with convenient way of specifying param grid
        - now starting to split out PR for column selectors
    - array api: updated ridgecv pr after r2 score was merged; opened LabelBinarizer pr


### Discussion points

- meson main build backend: do we want to merge soonish or do we want to wait, e.g. for
  + meson-python 0.16 release (not yet out) with for some quality of life enhancements,
    https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson-python/pull/594 and
    https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson-python/pull/569 (need Pytest<8 for now if you
    use `pytest --pyargs sklearn`)
  + Numpy 2 release (and scikit-learn 1.4.2 for Numpy 2 compatibility), to avoid having
    too many impactful changes at the same time ("what could possibly go wrong?")
  + other things?
    - [name=Guillaume] I think we should wait because we did not take some potential
      changes in 1.4.1 so it would be easier when branching 1.5
    - Conclusion: Merge the PR (and check the pyproject.toml) have it in main, but not
      backport it for the 1.4.2 release.
- Average ROC: https://openreview.net/forum?id=FByH3qL87G
    - PR https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25939
    - we need to make an editorial choice regarding the method
