# Scikit-learn Monthly Developer

## August 25, 2025 @ 4pm CEST

### Updates

- [name=Olivier] EuroScipy feedback:
    - array API was a popular topic
    - cross-project effort to provide a backend API (beyond what's possible with array API)
        - https://github.com/scientific-python/spatch
    - Tutorial on imbalanced classification presented at EuroScipy
        - Naive use of thresholded metrics: https://probabl-ai.github.io/calibration-cost-sensitive-learning/content/notebooks/imbalanced_classification.html
        - Dealing with prevalence shift between training set and deployment setting: https://probabl-ai.github.io/calibration-cost-sensitive-learning/content/notebooks/prevalence_correction.html
    - We had a (short) sprint with 4 new first time contributors
    - Unedited video recording of the sessions: https://www.youtube.com/@EuroSciPy/streams

- [name=Dea]
    - Worked on PR [ENH Adding a column to link each parameter docstring row in params table display](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/31564) Some changes: Tooltip added and column with links was removed. Ready for comments.
    - Opened issue about logo [Scikit-learn logo on the website is truncated](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/32011)
    - Is it on purpose to have an older version of sklearn in the mooc and in skolar?

- [name=Tim] GitHub has shipped some new Actions that use AI, with examples like "is this AI slop?"
    - https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/automate-your-project-with-github-models-in-actions/
        - https://github.com/github/ai-moderator - label things as spam
        - https://github.com/actions/ai-inference - make your own AI action
    - These are the result of a survey about a month ago where you could give feedback
        - was invite only but I think lots of people I know where invited
    - I'd be interested to try these out
        - it solves a real problem and
        - I am impressed GitHub shipped something with a quick turn around. Giving feedback feels useful
          - maybe if we give feedback we get more useful features, instead of the "random" AI features so far
    - Q: can we enable these on the main repo? What do people think?
        - if not, need to figure out a way to test drive from a fork?
        - cost, an obvious thing to figure out :D
        - Tim thinks prompt injection is the biggest risk
        - If the actions are useless we can turn them off again with a simple PR
    - We need to monitor the actions of the action
    - How to communicate publically that we are trialing this?
    - TODO:
        - First consider a welcome bot that gives a bit of very high-level guidelines
            - Old PR and discussion https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/27340
            - It should point to the contributor guide
            - This bot should quickly mention our stance on AI-generated PR
            - the welcome bot comments on an issue that is created by someone who has never created an issue
                - same for PR: it comments on the first PR a person creates
        - Second, possibly modulate the message using actions that use AI
            - Implement a first version that labels a PR as AI-generated as add a message that describe why we worry that there is no way forward and will not contribute well to the project
            - Work on the wording so that it is 1) informative, 2) pleasant
            - make sure we mention how people can appeal/report that the tool made a mistake
