# Scikit-learn Monthly Developer

## June 23rd 12pm CEST, 6am ET, 8pm AEST


### Updates

- [name=Olivier] Security report on GPU CI:
    - fixed
    - huntr won't automatically open a CVE because it's not a vulnerability in the library itself.
    - This vulnerability could not have be used to compromise the release-related workflow.
    - lesson: be careful about GHA worflows that execute in the `main` branch (as opposed to more isolated `pull_request` GHA workflows) because of cache poisoning threats
- [name=Loïc] Free-threading nightly build operational and uploads nightly wheels to:
    - https://pypi.anaconda.org/scientific-python-nightly-wheels/simple/
    - see https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29247 and https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29191 for more details

### Topics

- [name=Guillaume] Attending monthly Scientific Python meeting
- [name=Jeremie] 1.5.1 release planning
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29082
      needs work but maybe we can extract a smaller uncontroversial part for 1.5.1
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29330
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29314
- [name=Loïc] Remove setuptools (all `setup.py` files) build config from `main` before 1.6?
    - Ralf Gommers answered in the Scipy Slack that it was probably fine. Scipy did it slowly (`setup.py` renamed to `_setup.py`) because they were the first to switch. Numpy has switched to it for Numpy 2, matplotlib has done it as well, no major blocker.
    - open an issue about this mentioning Ralf Gommers and Linux distribution people involved in https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29327
