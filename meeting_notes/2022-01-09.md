# Scikit-learn Monthly Developer meeting
### January 9 @ 15:00 UTC


### Topics

- [name=adam2392] Improving the tree Cython/Python codebase to enable 3rd party extensions:
    - Motivation reminder: a lot of modern tree features require forking the sklearn codebase and are denied because "the tree codebase is hard to maintain", so modularity should make life easier for devs and users.
    - Simple short PRs to start the process: i) [Criterion to allow unsupervised criteria](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24678) ii) [Splitter to allow unsupervised splitting](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25101) iii) [Tree class to work with different splitters](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25118)
    - I am also proposing in general that we separate the API for setting a leaf/split node (a lot of modern-trees have this feature)
    - [More details on my proposals were written up in hackmd.](https://hackmd.io/TFmRQfFHSGucBt_Pk2gOWA)  I will not list all of them to not hog the meeting
    - [name=Julien Jerphanion] +1 for this refactoring as already mentionned in related issues. The main bottleneck is the number of Cython reviewers. Also [#25306](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25306) might need to be merged before the refactoring proposed in those PRs.
- [name=99991] Designate someone to accept scikit-learn.com domain https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/25332
    - Presumably, I can not join you due to other simultaneous obligations, sorry!
    - Decision: Evaluate the cost and consider accept the transfer, but not any other top domain
- [name=Thomas] Target Encoding? [#25334](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25334)
    - [name=Guillaume] I am going to provide a review now that the support scope is clearer (binary classification + regression)
- [name=Julien] FYI @micky774 and I were wondering about sharing our experience / tips / undocumented aspects of Cython. Here is a pad for adding some notes in this regard: https://hackmd.io/FR4Vp_OgR-WhlVEsVZzsIw
- [name=Olivier] created ci@scikit-learn.org used by the https://github.com/sklearn-ci account to `git push` to https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn.github.io from circle ci. It would be great to have 3 to 5 people on this alias for people interested in fixing CI issues. Volunteers?
    - [name=Thomas] I'll volunteer. I would be nice to figure out deployment keys, so an account is not required.
    - [name=Julien] I also volunteer to maintain via this alias.
- [name=Olivier] `sklearn.fixes.delayed` and thread-local config
    - currently we have verbose but explicit fix: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25242
        - [name=Guillaume] Going to make the `delayed` function private to have fix for the next 1.2.1 bugfix release.
    - we could make it less verbose by subclassing `joblib.Parallel` as `sklearn.fixes.Parallel`
    - this would be semi-public API for project (e.g. imbalanced-learn) that extend scikit-learn estimators and use joblib based parallelism.

### Need decision
- [name=Julien (proposed by Christian)] [Increase minimum Cython version to 0.29.33](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/25322)
    - This new release brings using `const`-qualified fused typed memoryviews, which should ease Cython maintenance!
    - Also related: [CI Use latest Cython sources in scipy-dev build](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25300) from @lesteve
### Need attention (reviews)

- [name=Julien] SLEP 19:
