### Release 0.24

- Release highlights are merged
- `_safe_tags` is reviewed twice and CI is green.
  There don’t seem to be red flags, probably ready for merge.
  This is the only blocker for the release.

### Need decision
- Christian: What are the next steps for features names?
  Some related links: [PR for SLEP015: Feature Names Propagation](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/48),
  [PR to Accept SLEP013](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/36) (SLEP013=n_features_out_ attribute),
  [last comment on PR SLEP0014](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/37#issuecomment-667759811)
  - Andy: n_features_out PRs, then feature name consistency, then feature names.
  - Thomas: column name consistency, `validate_data` on non-fit methods, then kwarg added to `transform`,
    but we haven't made a decision and the new PR is substantial change
  - All: we seem to have a half consensus on the transformer argument
  - Joel: another issue is deciding on how to represent the information in the output feature names
  - All: consensus on to introduce feature names as experimental, with a disclaimer for users to use it at their own risks.

### General topics
- Christian: [#16988](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/16988) Support numpy.random.Generator. Put it on v1.0 milestone?
  Let's keep it in the milestone for now, we can always remove it if there is no consensus at the time of the release.
    - Nicolas: we need to figure out how this impacts the state of random generation and its relation to CVs etc.
      For instance, passing None vs an int results in very different CV procedures and meta-estimators
      (cf https://scikit-learn.org/dev/common_pitfalls.html#controlling-randomness)
    - Christian: the new random generator has better random properties
  Also note [RFC design of random_state #14042](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/14042).
- Christian: Programmatically pass categorical_features to HGBT [#18894](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/18894)
  Accept pandas and do OE inside HGBT.fit?
  Re future (andy/gael discussion): the ecosystem will likely / hopefully move towards arrow and the data consortium API.
  The consortium API for dataframes is very close to pandas, meaning that starting with a prototype using pandas is likely a good way forward.
- Christian: Use of [black](https://black.readthedocs.io) for v1.0 milestone?
  - Thomas: `git blame` can be configured to don't care about black commit
  - Reshama: user experience depends a lot on the documentation about how to contribute.
      - Use of `black` by [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/development/contributing.html#python-pep8-black)
  - Guillaume: pre-commit to reformat the PR just before merge
  - Nicolas: useful in the long run
  - Thomas will open a PR
  - the stable documentation will be updated once the black style is applied
  - black formatting not good for notebook style examples.
  - Don't make it 1.0 milestone, we can do it any time
- Christian: Cut [A common private loss module](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/15123) into several PRs.
  Alex can work with Christian on this.

- Start to think about attributing tasks and delegate responsibility to the designated task force.
    - Olivier, Juan Carlos, Chiara are on the release, but everybody helps
    - Olivier, Thomas P and Adrin on feature names
    - Thomas P and Gaël on TargetEncoder (Gaël owes Thomas a review)
    - fit_transform != ? fit.transform: Gaël & Andy
        - https://scikit-learn-enhancement-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/slep001/proposal.html
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/issues/33
    - sample_props: Adrin, Alex, Christian, Joel

- designated teams are encouraged to meet more frequently and present a sum up of their progresses during the core-dev meeting.

- next meeting: January 4th at 20:00UTC (this will be the timeslot from now on)
