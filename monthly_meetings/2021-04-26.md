### Need decision
- (Thomas) [#19914](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19914) GAM with Gradient boosted trees
    - Here is an [example of the GAM](https://137869-843222-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/doc/auto_examples/ensemble/plot_gam_boosted_regression_simple.html) in action!
    - **Does this meet our inclusion criterion?**
    - Extension: Explainable Boosting Machine, see [this article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.09223.pdf)
    - Borderline with regards to inclusion criteron
    - inclusion vs. external `scikit-learn-extra`?
    - If there's a nice convincing example on the interpretability side, it'd be easier to decide.
    - Thomas will do benchmarks
- (Guillaume) [#19880](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/19880) Shape of predictions of multilabel classification
    - Historical difficulty comes from the fact that OnevsRest and MultiLabel are built on the same code
    - Look at the scorer / metrics to evaluate the RFC
        - Start by making the reporting working with different output formats?
- (Guillaume) [#19881](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/19881) Solving issue with `if_delegate_has_method` for nested meta-estimators
    - At fit time, the current implementation fails when the base estimator is a meta estimator
        - Solution: fitted estimator (or list of fitted estimators)
    - Joel has another approach, see the PR with a callable implemenation with `available_if`: [#19948](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19948)
    - Guillaume and Joel will consider the options and come back

### Need attention (review)
- (Guillaume) [#19963](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/19963) Issue with MacOS/Python 3.9/clang flags
    - Merged
- (Guillaume) [#19939](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19939) [#19952](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19952) GaussianProcess: issue consistency covariance/std. dev.
    - Olivier will look
- (Guillaume) [#19982](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19982) Regression `DictVectorizer` with dense input and list of strings
    - Easy review
- (Christian) [#19976](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19976) Remove deprecation of `loss="squared_error"` in HGBT and make it a hard renaming instead?
    - 4 people favor being nice, and 2 people sticking for following experimental (all the rest did not review)
- (Christian) [#9978](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/9978) Linear quantile regression
    - Needs review
- (Christian) [#19263](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19263) ENH Makes ColumnTransformer more flexible by only checking for non-dropped columns
    - Needs review for 1.0

### General topics

- (Guillaume) Bug fix release 0.24.2: [branching](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19954) preparing the release. Any major things that have been left-out?
    - People need to help Guillaume
- (Chiara) https://draft.scientific-python.org/ scikit-learn participation in the Steering Council.
    - Stefan van der Walt and Jarrod Millmann hope to find a way to better coordinate the scientific Python world (CI, common version numbers)
- (Guillaume) https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/13831 -> Back-compatibility for `pinv2` in scipy
    - Thomas goes on scipy
- (Christian) How about an issue to award ideas and PRs that reduce the amount of code and enhance maintainability?
- (Adrin) NumFocus's D&I (Diversity & Inclusion) efforts and demographic survey efforts.
    - Banner in documentation website
- (Adrin) NumFocus's education/training program/platform.
        - It's an idea to have a platform where people/projects can offer training and use that as a way to financially support the project. 
- (Adrin) **CoC:** We don't have a CoC council or email address.
    - CoC email address used to file complaints
    - CoC council handles complaints
    - Needs to be addressed by creating a mailing list and council
- (Lo√Øc) **MOOC:** Registrations to the "Machine learning in Python with scikit-learn" opened, see [this](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/en/courses/machine-learning-python-scikit-learn/). MOOC starts May 18. Most of the content (everything but videos and quiz solutions) is available [here](https://inria.github.io/scikit-learn-mooc/) and is CC-BY licensed.
- (Reshama) Data Umbrella Latin America Sprint

### Ongoing

- (Thomas) Working on rewriting [SLEP006 PR#55](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/55). Does not need attention from everyone yet, but if you are curious here is a [rendered version of the rewrite](https://thomasjpfan.github.io/enhancement_proposals/slep006/proposal.html).
  - (Joel) general issue seems to be that our  technically best solution is also difficult to get one's head around.
 - (Mathis and Julien) Started exploring pairwise distances improvements to have them run on chuncks on the two arrays with a reduction function to mitigate current bottlenecks in `KNeighborsMixin`'s
     - https://github.com/mbatoul/sklearn_benchmarks
     - Benchmark results and profiling reports: https://mbatoul.github.io/sklearn_benchmarks/
     - [19950](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19950): Private Cython module proposal to make use of C++ std library for GIL-free sort-related reduction functions (to be used in k-nearest neighbors and kmeans++ for instance)
     - [Some drafty notes one oneAPI's implementations](https://notes.inria.fr/uOCoCXIFRPKNo1v4j58E_A#)
 - `OneHotEncoder` infrequent categories [#16018](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/1601816018)
     - Guillaume will review

### Next Meeting
- May 25th same time as today
