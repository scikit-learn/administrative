# Scikit-learn Monthly Developer meeting
### May 22

### Topics

- [name=Adrin] Governance update: TC -> SC
    - Proposal: anybody from a core team can be a member of the SC, not only maintainers.

- [name=Adrin] 1.3 release?
    - [name=Jérémie] Yes, I was thinking about that as well. We can target first half of june.
      To do:
          - few deprecations clean up left
              (including https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26016)
          - highlights
          - test a few downstream dependencies
          - merge as many PRs as possible from the milestone :)
          - Trying to target early June

- [name=Meekail] Update API for `metric` keyword to allow passing `DistanceMetric` objects directly ([issue](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/26329), [sample PR](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26267)) to enable use of SIMD-accelerated distance metrics ([WIP here](https://github.com/Micky774/distmetric-xsimd))
    - This solution does little more than relax constraints and add documentation/tests.
    - As discussed, computational backends which extend *across* estimators may be out-of-scope of the initial release of plugins (meant to be estimator-specific implementations, mainly to enable GPU acceleration) therefore this API change would be orthogonal and would not require deprecation



### Updates

- [name=Adrin] internship: we have given Stefanie Segner an offer, she's accepted, and she'll start first of June. She'll be focusing on SLEP006 (metadata routing)

- [name=Olivier] Array API related things
    - Common tests and dedicated estimator tag:
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26372
    - Discussing inclusion of LU factorization in the Array API spec:
        - https://github.com/data-apis/array-api/issues/627
        - LU factorization would be useful for randomized PCA:
            - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26315
    - Discussing inclusion of argpartition and/or topk in the Array API spec
        - https://github.com/data-apis/array-api/issues/629
        - This would be useful to implement exact/bruteforce k-NN on GPUs via PyTorch
    - Discussing support for NaN reductions (`nanmax` and co):
        - https://github.com/data-apis/array-api/issues/621
        - This would be useful for MinMaxScaler (and others):
            - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26243
- [name=Meekail/Julien] Reminder to complete the internal-survey when you have some time ([link](https://forms.gle/NRDjuu7XL5Eabbok8))
- [name=Meekail] The initial release of HDBSCAN is nearly complete! [Final PR](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26385)

### Need decision

- [name=Adrin] How much do we want to keep updating MLP?
    - [This PR](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25646) adds sample weights for example.
    - For this PR we accept the contribution, but we should leave a note that people shoulnd't be using our MLP in serious cases.

### Need attention (reviews)

- [name=Thomas] Adds `categorical_features="pandas"` to `HistGradientBoosting*`: [#26411](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26411)
    - The cardinality for each category is still restricted above by max_bins.
- [name=Thomas] Enables missing values for random forest: [#26391](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26391)
- [name=Jérémie] Avoid repeated parameter validation (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25815). I think we should merge this before 1.3 if we decide to include it to avoid perf regressions.
