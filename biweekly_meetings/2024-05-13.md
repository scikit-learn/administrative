- [name=Adrin]
    - Reviews (a course has students sending PRs)
    - `numpy` hash based unique => speed in types of target, scores, confusion matrices
    - Pipeline's `transform_input`: [#28901](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28901)
    - Tags: starting the work with [#28927](https://github.com/scikit-learn/sci28320kit-learn/pull/28927)
        - Goal: make them public mid-term

    - `HalvingSearchCV`: [#28320](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28320)
        - Edge toward out of experimental
        - We still need to work on the API side for usability
- [name=Stefanie]
    - metadata routing for `Stacking*` [#28701](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28701) finished

        -  reviews with Olivier
        -  especially defining test cases
    - `check_scoring()` has `raise_exc` [#28992](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28992)
        - `raise_exc=False` for multimetric scoring
        - add test
- [name=Olivier]
    - Reviews on nan handling for `SplineTransformer` [#28043](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28043)
    - Discussed `RANSACRegressor`'s `sample_weight` handling with Shruti
    - Some testing of conda-forge's 1.5.0rc1 on macOS m1
    - Follow-up / reviews on Array API PRs
    - Some scipy-dev CI maintenance
- [name=Shruti]
    - Opened pull request to add sample weights to RANSAC estimator [#3](https://github.com/probabl-ai/scikit-learn-exercise-snath-xoc/pull/3)
      - Follow-up on ransac specific tests (e.g. score, default residual threshold and exceeding max skips tests)
- [name=Arturo]
    - Some [mooc PRs](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pulls)
- [name=Jérôme]
    - was away for most of April
    - mostly working on `skrub`: added selectors #895, more tests now run with polars #896 #903 PRs by Theo, refactoring/fixing the [TableVectorizer](https://github.com/skrub-data/skrub/pull/902)
    - addressed most of review of `LabelBinarizer` array API [PR](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28626), now updating the `RidgeCV` PR
    - a bit more on the skrub Recipe/PipelineBuilder/... and [skrubview](https://github.com/skrub-data/skrubview)
- [name=Loïc]
  + Complete Meson entry for scikit-learn 1.5 changelog https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29008. PR just opened, feed-back and discussions welcome! Current plan: drop setuptools support in scikit-learn 1.6 (but maybe rename `setup.py` -> `_setup.py` like Scipy did without testing it, and full drop in scikit-learn 1.7. This was useful for example for Pyodide scipy package).
  + some free-threading (aka nogil) work is happening in the Scientific Python ecosystem, quite excited about this! For example https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/28978. I added a free-threaded label to help track this.
- [name=Gael]
  + Moving contributors to emeritus: answers from all but one
  + More research than software, but paper behind hazardous (survival models) moving beautifully forward

### Discussion points

- re conda-forge build @ogrisel: https://github.com/conda-forge/scikit-learn-feedstock/pull/258
- re: array API: label binarizer's diff
- dropping setuptools support in scikit-learn 1.6 (or 1.7 with `_setup.py` approach) any quick opinion?
