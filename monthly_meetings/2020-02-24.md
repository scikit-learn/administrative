# Scikit-learn monthly meeting
## 24th February 2020


### General announcement

* SciPy tutorial: 2 tutorials: beginner and advanced
* Euro Python and Euro Scipy
    * EuroPython (Dublin) is a week before EuroScipy (Bilbao)
    * We probably would prefer EuroScipy
    * Roman may attend to EuroPython (submit a tutorial?)
* PyDataBerlin/PyConDE
    * Probably a tutorial together
* Rackspace
    * Olivier started the conversation at
      [#16412](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/16412)
    * The free account is expiring
    * Moving the wheels to anaconda.org
    * We probably need to help others in Scientific Python use the same platform
* core-dev sprint in Paris early summer?
    * June: everyone should advise Olivier on date constraints
    * Opportunity for sister sprints
    * Olivier would send an email and we start the planning
* GitHub started a more intense developer feedback
    * They're prioritizing stuff for the product team
    * We can give feedback
    * Andy and Nicolas are on that team
* bug fix release 0.22.2?
    * Nightly build link release update
    * backport of the few issues
    * with the new CI should be quick and easy
    * efficiency fix on the imputer (now added to the milestone)
    * Olivier et al can take care about making the backport PR
* release 0.23.0
    * aiming for feature freeze late April, to release in May (i.e. 5 month
      release)

### PR requiring reviews (Fast-Forward)

### Blocker in some PR/issues (Need decision)

* `n_features_in_` issue regarding the need to pass `y` or not -> use or not of
  an estimator tag
  [#16112](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16112)
    * we replace calls to check_X_y, and some estimators accept `y` to be
      `None`.
    * If you pass a `y=None` to a supervised estimator, the error is now
      changed.
    * One solution is to add an estimator tag (`is_supervised`)
    * The PR as is, just gives an odd message, but doesn't introduce a
      regression
    * always returning `y` from `validate_data` would give another sort of odd
      message
    * another alternative is a `SupervisedMixin`
        * it could either provide the tag, or a common `validate_data`
    * or a keyword arg to `validate_data`, and pass `y_required`
        * always pass `y`
        * but give the right error message if `y_required=False`
        * default could be `y=None, y_required=False`
        * cons:
            * may forget passing the right arg
            * looks odd to have to pass that in every single supervised
              estimator
    * Merging as is, we'll fix it before the release
* API issues regarding Individual Conditional Expectation
  [RFC](https://bit.ly/3a4tSUz),
  [#16164](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16164)
    * Resolved the issues, will reflect on the issue
* Resolve issues regarding example on interpretation of linear coefficients
  [proposal](https://bit.ly/3bRoWUF),
  [#15706](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/15706)
    * Guillaume proposes: merge as is (with the proposed change),
        get feedback and see how it is

#### New features

### Discussion related to SLEP

* [SLEP000](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/30): PR
  process, communication issues
    * seems we're okay with calling a vote on this

### Didn't manage to talk about

* Supporting pandas `pd.NA`
  [#16508](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16508)
* Keyword-only parameters
  [#16501](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16501)
* Inputs in `plot_confusion_matrix`
  [#15880](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/15880)
* Common test to check on preserving dtype and minumum copies
  [#16290](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16290)
* [SLEP014](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/37):
  pandas-in/out
* [SLEP007](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/38):
  Overwriting default `feature_names`
* [SLEP013](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/36):
  Motivation behind `n_features_out_`

#### Bug fixes - easy changes

  tag) [#16185](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16185)
