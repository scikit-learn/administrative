### The 0.22 release
- RC
- What's new fixes
- Release highlights
  [#15152](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/15152)
- Build/packaging issues
  * cython & sdist
    [#15335](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/15335)
    Cythonized souces shouldn't be included in the sdist, and allow people to
    have different versions of cython. It's done in Numpy. It also causes an
    issue when it was cythonized using openmp and sdist installed on a system
    w/o openmp.

- To get in:
    - [#15274](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/15274)
      (support multiclass in `_ThresholdScorer`). It's a simple PR, needs
      reviews. It's a blocker.
    - plot_precision_recall_curve
      [#14936](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/14936). Goal
      is to release more than one plot API instnace. Needs review. This has
      higher priority than confusion matrix.
    - plot_confusion_matrix
      [#15083](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/15083). Needs
      review.
    - Column Selector
      [#12371](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/12371).
      Getting in, easy.
    - some things we resolved about encoders
      [#15050](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/15050),
      [#14984](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/14984). These
      are fixing up user traps for string-based categories (released 0.19).
      Need reviews, not blockers.
    - Use `FutureWarning` instead of `DeprecationWarning` to avoid our custom
      filter which makes people angry
      [#15080](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/15080). Needs
      to be merged if we're all okay with it. We're okay with it.
  - [#9250](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/9250) (make
    modules private). Almost done.
  - [#15303](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/15303) (should
    we remove `pos_label` in `plot_roc_curve` since we do not have a
    `pos_label` parameter in `roc_auc_score`?). We don't infer `pos_label`
    authomatically in some places, and do in other places. So we're not
    consistent with it. There is some logic behind the incosistency. We should
    still discuss. It's critical, needs discussion.
  - [#15164](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/15164)
    `RidgeClassifier`, why do we need it? Answer: we have a bunch of
    classifiers that don't have user manuals. This fixes one of them. For
    instance RidgeClassifier works well with least square loss. Olivier has a
    very clear idea why it's usuful.
  - Blocker Bug in iterative imputer (it doesn't converge with RF)
    [#14338](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/14338)
    - It's experimental
    - Not a blocker
  - [#15010](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/15010) Missing
    indicator in KNNImputer
  - [#14028](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/14028) dataframe
    support in PDP


* Big changes are introduced in the new release (deprecated paths, etc). We
  should probably make it known well in advance. Tweet about it?? Mention it in
  the release highlights?


### The next release
Top priorities for 0.23
* Blog, tweet, etc., especially for the release.
    * we could have a blog.scikit-learn.org
    * release highlight examples can be moved to blog
    * it also encourages people who are good writers but don't want to send
      PRs, and stil be active in the community.
- Towards fixing the random_state statefulness issue:
  [#15177](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/15177). Note that
  this causes a **bug** if we warm-start successive halving. Splitters don't
  have a fit method.
* Successive halving
* DataFrame-related things: feature names and categoricals, etc.
* Bringing the open SLEPs to vote!
* (I'd also like to see GLMs, but I don't see myself being able to review)
- NamedArray -
  [#14315](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/14315) - What is
  the goal of this feature? @adrinjalali
- Move forward with [`_validate_data`
  SLEP](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/22)
- Freezing [#8370](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/8370).
- GLMS [#14300](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/14300)!!!
* confirm approach to openmp
    [#15174](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/15174). The
    behavior is changed that if openmp is no there, it still builds
    successfully. It only warns in sklearn import time. The main issue is
    MacOS, and the warning links to instructions on how to install on MacOS so
    that the warning is gone. The original reason for this was that it was hard
    during Sprints, and that issue is fixed now. Alternatively, we could
    reorganize the installation instructions in the dev guide.


### Mid-term goals
* It seems from issues being raised recently that people are increasingly using
  Pipeline infrastrucutre, thanks perhaps to `ColumnTransformer`... It makes
  things like [sample
  props](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/16) more
  important.
- Lot of testing in threadpoolctl
- ongoing: towards a [scikit-learn
  MOOC](https://github.com/lesteve/scikit-learn-tutorial). The plan is to have
  enverything on github and open license, including the videos. The interface
  and the content (primarily) will be in English. The audience of this effort
  may be people who are less technically savvy than Andy's audience. But
  there's overlap with Andy's past efforts.
- Make sure CI fails on deprecation/future warnings. The public/private
deprecations warnings aren't all caught by `pytest`. We'll need more thorough
manual checks. Mostly done, some PRs need to be merged. Sometimes CI doesn't
fail if there are some new deprecation warnings.
[#15381](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/15381)

### Project management
* There's enough activity on the repo that we could use a little bit of project
  management. Reviewing the roadmap, watching the issues/PRs, and reminding
  people.
* Module labels: module:ensemble - we use do have this, it was not useful,
  maybe it is now? (andy)


### Misc
- Intel packaging: the daal4py is not enabled by default on their soft-fork.
  But it gives a warning/message that they can enable that. Intel's Numpy is
  very different from the official Numpy. Intel still are not completely on the
  same page, hence Gael's response to them.


## Next meeting time
Monday 18th November.
