# Scikit-learn Monthly Developer

## December 18th 2023

### Updates

- 1.4 release
    - Maybe RC before Christmas, but not release to avoid screwing up our vacations

### Topics

### Need decision

### Need attention (reviews)

### Discussion

- vision statement
    - Should we discuss this here?
    - current version: "Empowering everyone to unlock the transformative power of data through intuitive, accurate, and trustworthy open source machine learning."
    - Link please
        - right now this is on the mailing-list
        - notes from Paris sprint: https://hackmd.io/H_CrV5OvSYiJVI-kWEg8ow
    - do some "word engineering" on the mailing list to help converge on some nice wording that doesn't sound too corporate,
      doesn't use too many words
    - create a blog post about how we got to the vision statement
        - less of a chronological report of the process, more about "why now"
        - expand on each of the words in the statement that explains each word to help unpack what each means
    - Democratizing accurate, trustworthy, and open machine learning.
    - **Make trustworthy and open machine learning accessible**
        - Submit to mailing open vs open source
        - Point raised that accessible might be understood in the sense of "accessibility"
            - thesaurus suggests
        - Add to blog: Notion of commons is important beyond open source
- X_val in HGBT, https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27124
  Set up a meeting date for discussion.
  (more general about providing a validation set for early stopping and monitoring)
    - Important point: when you need precise control for your validation set, things are hard
        - Option 1: people must use splitters
        - Option 2: pass the data
    - With pipeline and meta-estimator, the question is whether you want split in the outer estimator or the inner estimator
    - usability: compare using a callable vs explicitly passing in the validation dataset for the case where there is a column
      that tells you validation true/false.
        - Interacts with meta-data routing
        - a requirement for a nice solution is that should be simple to do this
    - "This is like eating vegetables when you are a kid"
    - Resolution: Meeting on Jan 19th, 9am (Europe time) to discuss this further
