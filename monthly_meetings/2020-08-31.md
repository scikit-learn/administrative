# August 31st 2020 -- Scikit-learn dev meeting

### Need decision

- It would be good to decide on a date for the v1.0 release and what we would like to include there
[#14386](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/14386#issuecomment-678121291).
See also the the [1.0 milestone](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/milestone/9).
For instance, release v0.25 (spring 2021) or v0.26 (fall 2021) could be published as v1.0.
The change in the major version could be useful to break backward compatibility on some features: how deprecations will be managed?
Should we use the same deprecation cycle or we want to change it, moving to version 1.0?
  - Adrin, Gael: having the version 1.0 opens the door to discussions about deeper API changes.
  But this is risky and the soft consensus is that we want not to go overboard.
  - Olivier, Andreas: having version 1.0 is a way to say that scikit-learn is stable and ready for
  production environment. Backward compatibility could be break in 2.0. 
  - Gael: it would be appropriate to have implementation of [sample properties](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/16) in 1.0.

  *Decisions*:
    - Aiming for 0.25 to be 1.0 (May 2021)
    - Create a label "[Breaking Change](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/labels/Breaking%20Change)" and tag the issues and PRs to be in 1.0 that will break backward compatibility. 

- (Nicolas, Guillaume) `plot_XYZ()` utilities: scorer vs metric (or both) APIs?
[15880](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/15880),
[18020](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18020), etc.
Toward making class methods.
Conclusion from Joel: "it's a naming problem", we can also have multiple functions with different signatures that call the same underlying code.

- (Joel) Should we deprecate multilabel support in OneVsRestClassifier? (related to [#17811](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17811)):
addressed as a documentation problem in the referenced PR and should be addressed in the documentation for now.

- (Guillaume) Issue with global setting and joblib [#17643](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17634)
    - How does joblib work with global settings for a library using joblib?
    - Global settings don't propagate consistently when using joblib / multiprocessing
    - Generally globals and parallel processing can not be entirely resolveed (race conditions etc)
    - For dask backend: a worker can be client to several processes, so it might be tricky to have consistent configuration.
    - Unclear if we want to fix the usage of other libraries like pandas within scikit-learn or joblib
    - Thomas Moreau: Unrealistic for joblib to figure out what to propagate. Instead provide hook for user.
    - config manager is not thread-save (should that be fixed?). as long as the config object is small, doing thread-level configuration is fine. If we want to do custom array_out interfaces this might be more tricky (but unclear).
    - Plan: hook in joblib to allow a library to register context passing into each task (like [#17634](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17634) but joblib-managed). Also, config stored in thread-local container.
    - Should scikit-learn deal with propagating configuration for pandas and numpy? Not for now. Joblib might encourage an "export configuration" interface so scikit-learn knows how to export pandas options in the future.

### Need attention (review)
No discussion here, please take a look, as people could move on on their work: thanks!

- (Nicolas) Cross-decomposition fixes and docs [17095](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17095). Already +1.
I won't be able to address reviews after October.
- (Thomas) Typing support ready for review [17799](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17799)
    - Some discussions and feedback from numpy / pandas starts [here](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/16705#issuecomment-683477933)
- (Guillaume) new common tests for some meta-estimators [18045](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18045),
[18054](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18054), [18158](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18158)
(already some approval - even 2 sometimes)
- (Guillaume) Clean-up of metrics: [18110](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18110),
[18114](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18114),
[18183](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18183) + [RFC](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/18307),
[18192](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18192).
Needed to properly implement [16525](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16525).

### General topics

- (Nicolas) We should try to answer [this comment](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/16802#issuecomment-619472878)
about why don't want p-values in LogisticRegression. Gael has addressed the comment.

- (Christian) How to preceed with common private loss function module [15123](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/15123)?
[Design](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/15123#issuecomment-635232901) is so far blocked by the
[Cython bug](https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/3607).
Cython devs are very busy so let's try to fix it or have a work around... or just wait for cython people.

- (Joel) Procedure for [SLEP006](https://scikit-learn-enhancement-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/slep006/proposal.html) ("Sample Props").
It is (nearly) ready to go to vote, but it will probably need some robust discussion, and the prototype in
[#16079](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16079) is not yet complete. When should we bring it to vote?
Andreas: we don't need an implementation.
Please review the current version (at least solution 4). Should be in 1.0.

- (Thomas) Been working toward array_out='pandas' support [16772](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16772)
which also implements [SLEP 007](https://scikit-learn-enhancement-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/slep007/proposal.html).
Things get a little complicatd when a user uses a third party library that depends on scikit-learn.
If a user sends array_out='pandas', this would change the output of transform to pandas, and the third party library may not expecting this.
Two problems here:
  - output structures compatible with third party libraries
  - using those structures as internal format in scikit-learn pipelines

  Possible solutions:
  - via a context-manager
  - add a `transform_to_frame` method in Pipeline, converting outputs to frames
  - add a parameter to `transform` like numpy dtype to specify output format
