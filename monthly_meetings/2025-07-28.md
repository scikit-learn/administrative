### Updates

- [name=Olivier] who else will attend EuroScipy next month?
    - https://euroscipy.org/schedule/ (Guillaume, Loic, Tim and Olivier are on the schedule).
    - Tim isn't actually going

- [name=Lo√Øc] reasons for our [guideline](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/develop.html#coding-guidelines) "use relative imports except in tests". Opinions about moving to absolute imports, which seems like it can be enforced by `ruff`, see [comment](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/31817#issuecomment-3126920545).
    - one possible pro for relative imports: shorter lines for import statements (but we would need to check that it's actually the case)
    - pros for absolute:
        - more readable;
        - less complex policy (absolute everywhere like most other projects);
        - easy to have a linter to make it consistent and maybe autofix problems.
    - PR to switch to absolute imports: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/31847

- [name=Tim] Using the "spam" label (again)
    - we are receiving more issues and PRs that are spam-y
    - start using the "spam" label for spam and other low effort (e.g. fully automated tool without human review, no human-in-the-loop LLM, duplicate PRs that look autogenerated)
    - not meant to be used to label PRs that need a lot of mentoring
    - adding a FAQ entry https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/31822
        - give some advice to users what happened
    - Once we've used it a bit more we can use it to get stats on how big the problem is, etc
        - then decide next steps (bots, etc)
    - goal is to reduce maintenance
        - maybe add a bot that adds "linter failure" label
    - "not good enough" (or "closing candidate") to just label, should have a link to FAQ entry as well
    - TODO write a blog post that highlights contributions we do not want
    - TODO explain why we use the label
    - TODO make distinction between closed+label and just label


### Topics

### Need attention/decision

- [name=Olivier] sponsor blog post by probabl about the skolar educational platform: https://github.com/scikit-learn/blog/pull/217
    - refer to SLEP and give feedback on it. https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/92
    - render preview for the blog post?
        - we could use netlify with the open source plan:
            - https://www.netlify.com/legal/open-source-policy/
            - https://opensource-form.netlify.com/
