# Scikit-learn Monthly Developer 

## Jan 29th 5pm CEST, 11am ET

### Updates

### Topics

 - [name=Julien] [SPEC 0 -- Minimum Supported Versions](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0000/)
     - Might be useful for maintainance, yet might be constraining for end-users
     - Let's provide feedback on [the dedicated discourse's thread for SPEC 0](https://discuss.scientific-python.org/t/spec-0-minimum-supported-versions/33/13)?
     - Discussions:
         - We need to have / write a rule explicit (e.g. explain that we need not drop old versions and that we only bump them when required)
         - Julien to write an email to cast a vote on the private mailing list.
 - [name=Guillaume] Improve search bar of the documentation website
     - https://docsearch.algolia.com/ + integration with sphinx. Try it on https://pytorch.org/
     - Is it worth the extra engineering effort compared to sphinx built in search and/or pointing people to a real search engine?
     - Q: should we make a PR that lets us test this?
         - no objections to trying it out to learn more. In particular about hidden limitations and how well it works in practice
     - [name=Olivier] [name=Julien] think the UX improvement are worth at least trying it. We can always revert back to the current built-in sphinx search if we discover that algolia is troublesome to maintain or rate limited.
 - [name=Guillaume] Release 1.4.1
     - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+milestone%3A1.4.1
     - 2 important regressions
     - Wise to release ASAP (coming 1-2 weeks)

### Need decision

### Need attention (reviews)

 - [name=Julien] [BUG "array-like" in parameter validation treats sparse containers as valid inputs](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/28099)
     - Discussions:
         - Currently block PRs for sparse arrays
         - [`_is_arraylike`](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/cb836be0ff8347ccb0ab722760df68d07485101e/sklearn/utils/validation.py#L291-L293) returns `True` on `scipy.sparse` matrices, yet the [glossary states that "array-like" does not include sparse matrices](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/glossary.html#term-array-like).
         - Proposal: change the behavior of `_is_arraylike` to actually excluse sparse matrices but include sparse arrays without changing users' workflow.

### Discussion

- [name=Loïc] Feed-back on Meson usage? Try it out: `make dev-meson`, see [doc](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/advanced_installation.html#building-with-meson) for more details. I would like to gather feed-back and swith to Meson as main build tool in 2-3 weeks if no major blocker, thoughts?
    - those who tried it find it quite nice
        - the message/behaviour of rebuilding on demand is a bit confusing the first few times
        - can achieve same speed as meson by configuring setuptools to build in parallel
    - https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson-python/pull/562 needs fixing before we can switch or we need to change our test infra to solve this problem
        - right now some tests are not executed because of this, also in scipy
    - in the next release use meson, but keep setuptools infrastructure
    - in the next next release remove setuptools infrastructure. Code and documentation will be cleaned up
- [name=Loïc] Disallow push to upstream? Cons: you can not merge a PR when there is a spurious CI failure aka "Merge without waiting for requirements to be met (bypass branch protections)" tick-box. See [Discord message](https://discord.com/channels/731163543038197871/1200020118093189171/1200064272869367928) for more details.
    - try it out for now.
    - try to avoid discussing yes/no on this topic "every few months". maybe by writing down decision and thinking around it in developer docs
- [name=Loïc] Feeling on using [spin](https://github.com/scientific-python/spin) (Scientific Python INcantations)? Advantages:
  + making it easier for contributors to setup environment, build, tests, build documentation, etc ...
  + make possible commands discoverable
  + used by numpy, scikit-image, probably others
  + extendable if we need/want to add custom commands, e.g. update lock-files, create the same environment as in the CI with conda-lock (for the easy cases i.e. same OS), etc ...
  + discussion:
      + newcomers need to learn/understand/trust yet a new tool
          + "Spin what is this?"
      + improves developer UX
      + need to work on avoiding a layering of tools
          + e.g. spin calls make calls setuptools calls pytest and so on - a layer cake of tools that call tools
- [name=Olivier] RFC on reproducible builds to detect potential supply chain attacks: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/28151
- [name=Olivier] Status about the possibility of setting up a GPU CI, possibly based on cirun or anything else.
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/24491
