### Updates

- [name=Olivier] Found out that sigmoid calibration can actually work, event for multiclass when preprocessing probas into OvR logits:
    - [https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/compare/main...ogrisel:scikit-learn:fix-always-use-logits-in-CalibratedClassifierCV](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/compare/main...ogrisel:scikit-learn:fix-always-use-logits-in-CalibratedClassifierCV)
    - Will finalize the branch and open a PR soon-ish.

### Topics

- [name=Olivier] 1.7 release planning:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20milestone%3A1.7%20
        - communicate the release plan more publicly (mailing list)
        - release manager should use a pinned issue 1 or 2 months the planned release date so that we better communicate.
- [name=Sylvain] working on Yeo-Jonhson and eigsh randomized solver
    - Yeo Johnson https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/31227
    - Randomized eigh solver on KernelPCA and Isomap https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/31247
    - Randomized eigh could benefit from array API support as follow-up work https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/array_api.html
    - Randomized eigh/svd could benefit to other estimators (example : MDS https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22330). Would be a good idea to list all of them.
    - Possible upgrade in the future: object-oriented modeling of solvers (abstract classes SVDSolver, EIGHSolver). Suggestion: do the same as for Loss Functions for now: keep object-oriented internal/private, and duplicate the parametrization of all in all constructors. Drawbacks: when a new solver pops up (e.g. lobpcg, amg...), this implies major refactoring on all estimators. So let's see how big is this list of impacted estimators to estimate the impact.

- [name=Dea] Elements in the HTML Display used to show the name (set by the user) but not any more. Is that on purpose? This was the first PR that introduced it https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/14180
    - [name=Tim] is there a picture of what it looks like now?
    - [name=Dea] Yes: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/compose/plot_column_transformer_mixed_types.html (at the bottom)

- [name=Gaetan] Joined Probabl as an intern 3 weeks ago, to work on implementing unbiased feature importance for tree-based models. PR for random forests should be up today
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/20059

### Need attention/decision

- Narwhals adoption: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/31049
  In particular https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/31049#issuecomment-2770667217
  - continue exploring in Christian's PR how much simplication we can get by drop as much internal DF code as possible
  - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/31127
  - getting rid of pandas code is complex because of copy warnings: even using the latest narwhals version we would still need some pandas specific tricks.
- Transition from sparse matrices to sparse arrays https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/26418
    - Global config option to set what type of output
    - deprecate the use of the global option from the start to encourage removal of it again

- [name=Thomas] New chair person for scheduling this meeting
    - Time slot policy: stopped surveying at each time.
    - Can we replace thomas by recurring appointment in google calendar?
