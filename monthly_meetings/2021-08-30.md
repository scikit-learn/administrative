### Need decision

### Need attention (reviews)

- (Thomas) Support classification targets encoded as bytes? [#18555](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18555#pullrequestreview-713937826)
    - At least we need a test to know whether it works or not.
    - Then decide if we deprecate or not.
    - Nobody raised a valid use case.
    - Push a bit further little the [tests](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19938)
- (Guillaume) Make plotting consistent before 1.0 (neglecting `plot_partial_dependence`)
    - Change of API for the plotting helpers [#17443](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17443) [#20569](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20569) [#20552](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20552)
    - New plotting displays (could be omitted for 1.0) [#18020](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18020) [#16061](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16061)
- (Julien) Private Cython submodule for aggregations over pairwise distances [#20254](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20254)
    - Start of discussions about recent changes ([`scipy/scipy#13907`](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/13907)) in `scipy.spatial.distances`: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20254#issuecomment-894715057
    - Thomas will talk to folks at Scipy about including this change upstream

### General topics

- (Olivier) Interop API for dataframe libraries:
  RFC: https://data-apis.org/blog/dataframe_protocol_rfc/
  GitHub repo: https://github.com/data-apis/dataframe-api
- (Olivier) feature names progress report: [#18010](
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18010)
  and linked issues at the bottom.
  Next step update, review and merge the
  `get_feature_names_out` PR: [#18444](
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18444)
      - list vs ndarray => ndarray
      - str/unicode numpy dtype vs object dtype with str values => Python str
  and then we can reconsider what do for datastruct-in
  / datastruct-out with feature names.
- (Olivier) do you agree with non-prefixing ColumnTransformer by default when no feature name collision happen? See:
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18444/files#r697848244
  This requires amending SLEP7.
  - Visualization vs programmatic access
  - Prefixing by default, option to disable prefix with error in case of collision + auto option to prefix only when name collision
  - Do not call at fit time, only when calling `get_feature_names_out()` as some cases are pathological (HashingVectorizer)
- (Reshama, Thomas) adding pipeline diagrams to do
    - [PR #18758](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18758)
- (Thomas) Small adjustment to API for `n_features_in_`, which may impact `feature_names_in_`: [#20874](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/20874)
    - remove `n_features_in_ == None`

### Release status & co
- <del>(Thomas) Fix osx wheels: [#20470](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20470)</del> Merged!

### Fun topics
- (Christian, can't attend, but this is fun and might interest you) Is it OK, technically or philosophically, for P/Cython code to *lie*? (Which leads to: Does the end justify the means?)
  Example: [PR #20567](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20567#issuecomment-907784059) and [commit 130306c](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20567/commits/130306c5bf69708f5785cfd8d338b894c84ceb0a). A lie allows to mimic `const` typed memoryviews which will arrive with Cython 3.0, but until then....

### Next meeting date and chair person
- Monday, September 27, same time!
