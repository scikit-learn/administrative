# May 25 2020 -- Scikit-learn dev meeting

### 0.23.x release: lessons learned?

- downstream integration testing
  - dependency issues [#15992](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/15992):
    - imbalanced-learn (Guillaume will open an issue with the details)
    - keras
    - lightGBM
  - performances issues (e.g. Kmeans [#17230](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/17230),
    [#17208](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/17208))
    - ASV benchmarks (running every day / week as pandas does) can be a solution
      ([#17026](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17026)): PR to be merged and benchmarks automatized.
  - identify a collection of Jupyter Notebooks to run (amueller class notebooks? / book) - maybe just to check for errors
- better documentation on changing parameters and common check
- identify scikit-learn estimators that don't pass scikit-learn checks, inparticular affected by warnings in `set_param`:
  a work in progress PR has been proposed ([#16945](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16945))
- update the documentation to the actual release process: Thomas asks for a dedicated discussion.
    - e.g. test on conda-forge before tagging
    - sdist is built on the CI (but is not fetched with `fetch_artifacts`)
    - document how to buid and test the release branch/PR on conda-forge before pushing the tag

### Need decision

- (Nicolas) Need decision for the parameter about handling unkown values in `OrdinalEncoder`:
  see [discussion](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16959#discussion_r422499148)
  (to be checked at next meeting)
- (Thomas) Should "dataframe" be included in the docstring under "Parameters":
  see [discussion #16656](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16656#issuecomment-629708463)
    - In the glossary there is an [array-like](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/glossary.html#term-array-like) definition
      including dataframe with numeric columns only. If a dataframe does not contain numeric columns only, it is accepted
      that is not array-like, it should be documented as dataframe in the docstring.
- (Nicolas) Need to settle on a design for the `check_estimator` strict mode:
    - latest prototype at [#17252](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17252):
      treat strict checks as if they're in the `_xfail_checks` tag.
    - granularity: Do we
      - a) allow strict and non-strict parts inside a given check, or
      - b) should checks be fully strict / fully non-strict? -> non strict parts makes it easier to not validate specific
        error messages.
    - strict-mode parameter in check_estimator, or as a tag? --> No objection to using parameter
        
    Nicolas will extend to having strict parts inside a single check and ping everyone when done
- (Thomas) Feature names with pandas or xarray, benchmark for sparse case.
  See [benchmark #16772](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16772#issuecomment-615423097).
  No consensus in today discussions: Andy needs to do more benchmarks.
- (Adrin) NumFocus agreement. There are some additional comments in the doc. Still in discussion, in particular issues are
  about harmonizing USA and EU legislations.
- TODO: update TC board doc with Adrin membership. Andreas will sent an e-mail to the list with the announcement.

### Other topics

- We're doing a sprint on Sat June 6th, if you have issue ideas add them
  [here](https://github.com/data-umbrella/2020-sklearn-sprint/projects/1)!
- Remote sprints at scipy (Nicolas will check scipy answer) and
  [europython](https://wiki.python.org/moin/EuroPython2020/Sprints)
- Small sprint with Consortium members from 23rd to 26th June: this is aimed to involve the Consortium partners letting
  the core-devs more available for Community sprints. 
- Follow-up informal meetings after the sprint could be a way to make sprint participants be more involved after a sprint.
