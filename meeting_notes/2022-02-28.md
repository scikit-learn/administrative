# Scikit-learn Monthly Developer meeting
### February 28 2022 @ 20:00 UTC

When you add an entry, please add you  name next to it.

### Topics
- (Thomas) Quick Update on [Scientific Python Ecosystem Community](https://discuss.scientific-python.org/c/contributor/12)
    - Most activity on the discourse
    - Much discussion around dispatching (array operation)
    - Also discussion on accessibility
    - Maybe future SPEC on synchronizing low-level libraries (eg for parallelism)
- (Thomas) Overview of [Array API PR](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22554)
    - Authors (Thomas) is half happy with the PR
    - One difficulty is testing (for instance not clear how to test with cupy without corresponding hardware)
    - Pytorch hosts CI on circleCI, paying to have GPU support
- (Olivier) Moving away from Google Analytics (GDPR, [CNIL announcement](https://www.cnil.fr/en/use-google-analytics-and-data-transfers-united-states-cnil-orders-website-manageroperator-comply))
    - matomo hosting at Inria?
    - negotiate discount/free account with matomo / plausible / fathom for 10M pageviews per month?
    - Regular price is ~150 euros/month.
    - (Thomas) SciPy is using a self-hosted plauisble instance: [scipy/scipy#338](https://github.com/scipy/scipy.org/issues/338) hosted by [views.scientific-python.org](https://views.scientific-python.org)
    - Resolution: experiment with the Inria matomo and keep the google analytics in parallel. But first experiment with the jupyter-book for the MOOC

### Need decision
- (Jérémie) Default value of some parameters make little sense
  see https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/13570
  and https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/14942
  Propositions:
    - warning,
    - in the ``__repr__``,
    - logging,
    - ``_required_parameters``, ...

  Temporary Resolution:
  - discuss in the issue what we want to say to the users for these params
    and build a list of such params.
  - ``__repr__`` is the most promising option, using the html view
  - Open a meta issue listing the defaults that must be changed, and then address them one by one, with a slow deprecation cycle

### Need attention (reviews)
- (Christian) [#15263](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/15263) How to add interaction terms with categorical variables, in particual for linear models?
  **If HGBT gets interaction constraints, then linear models should be given interaction terms!**. I'm stuck to find a good API:
  - A new dedicated `InteractionTransformer` or extend `PolynomialFeatures`?
  - An argument to specify groups (indices) of columns stemming from OHE?
  - Better pass ordinal encoded variables and do the OHE inside?
  - Better specify interactions inside the linear model?
  - Support `cat * cat` and `cat * num`. `num * num` is already covered by `PolynomialFeatures`.
  - [formulaic](https://github.com/matthewwardrop/formulaic) as replacement for patsy: could it be time to rewrite [patsylearn](https://github.com/amueller/patsylearn) on top of formulaic?
  - If we constraint ourselves to interactions, we could write a specific transformer without all the complexity of patsy, but if we want to add more features (like log, exp) we might reimplement patsy.
  - Consider a feature combination transformer that screens based on a Friedman H test statistics https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/22383
 - (Julien) `PairwiseDistancesReduction` follow-ups, see issue [#22587](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/22587):
     - Radius neighborhood [#22320](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22320) (some C++/Cython gymnastics)
     - float32 data support [#22590](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22590) (some Tempita gymnastics; still in discussion)
- (for Adrin) Base sample props [#22083](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22083)
  Let's bring it in 1.1
