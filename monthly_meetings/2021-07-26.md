### Need decision

- [name=Guillaume] 79 vs 88 characters in code base: [poll results](https://doodle.com/poll/wpp7c8343zy46v93?utm_source=poll&utm_medium=link) ðŸ™ƒ
    - No 2/3rd majority, so we move to the TC
- [name=Christian] Common losses: [#19088](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19088) and [#20567](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20567) which its Tempita version
    - The 2 PRs are the same, with the difference that one uses tempita to reduce the redundancy. The question is whether it is worth doing this (added sophistication, reduced code duplication)
    - Motives for the second PR: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19088#discussion_r634189970
        - Need review
- [name=Guillaume] API for column name consistency: [#18010](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18010)
    - one decision left on API
    - The question is what to do with column names that are integers
        - Option a) is to convert integers to strings by default and raise a warning
        - Option b) is to ignore feature names (disable the consistency check) when there is a .column that we don't support (some column with integer and some string).
        - One thought is that if we start by being strict we can always become lenient
        - Example in [Rstats](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/12-supp-factors/)
    - Options that seem to be rejected:
        - automatically convert integers to strings
        - accepting and storing integers as feature names
    - **Resolution: option b, without warning**

### Need attention (reviews)

- [name=Guillaume] API PDP for categorical features: [#18298](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18298)
    - Question: how to specify categorical feature:
        - tuple with boolean specifying which feature is categorical
        - The discussion is in the comments [here](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18298#discussion_r673439548)
- [name=Guillaume] Plotting API refactoring:
    - ROC curve display [#20569](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20569)
    - Precision-recall curve display [#20552](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20552)
    - DET curve display [#19278](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19278)
    - Calibration plot (Lucy) [#17443](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17443)
- [name=Guillaume] PD-ICE improvements: [#18310](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18310) [#19438](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19438) [#19428](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19428)
- [name=Guillaume] Example improvements:
    - kPCA examples: [#19945](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19945)
    - GPR examples: [#20360](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20360) [#20359](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20359) [#20358](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20358) [#20357](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20357)
    - Tutorial example: [#18821](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18821)
- [name=Julien] Private Cython submodule for aggregations over pairwise distances [#20254](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20254)
    - I still have aspects to improve but most of it is there and I would be happy to discuss the design and implementations.
    - I've tried to have a generic interfaces w.r.t potential new specialised kernels.
    - Some refactoring:
        - `neighbors.DistanceMetric` has been moved to `metrics.DistanceMetric`:
            - New interfaces for {sparse, dense} vectors support
            - This interface is public, but [should we make it private?](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20254#pullrequestreview-707484413)
        - Extracted `neighbors.NeighborHeaps`
        - Some more...
    - Last benchmark pointers: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20254#issuecomment-886910587
    - I am thinking to split it in several PRs easing reviews: WDTY?

### General topics

- [name=Guillaume] Predictions shape consistency regressor for single target: [#20603](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20603). Context: output shape is inconsistent when passing `y` with shape = `(n_samples, 1)`, see [here](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20355#discussion_r664346982).

- [name=Olivier] Ongoing technical discussions with Intel for pairwise distances + reduction GPU optimization (as an extension to scikit-learn).

    - Julien started centralizing an optimized Cython/OpenMP (CPU) implementation of this computational pattern in [#20254](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20254). This can give multiple x speed-up for k-NN, BIRCH prediction, neighbors graph computation for TSNE, DBSCAN and probably others later with more code refactoring (Gaussian Processes, SVMs, Nystroem... anything that uses kernels or pairwise distances). The optimized KMeans of Jeremie can be made to also reuse this private code pattern.
    - This pattern can probably also run well on GPUs from NVidia, Intel, AMD... Having this code centralized means that it will make it possible to have optional dependencies to move this computation to GPUs.
    - Intel is interested with colaborating with Inria to [implement a proof of Concept in Cython/C++](https://github.com/oleksandr-pavlyk/pdist_aggregation/tree/add_sycl_impl/sycl_ext) based on [dpctl](https://github.com/IntelPython/dpctl). It could also be possible to have alternative implementations using numba via [numba-dppy](https://intelpython.github.io/numba-dppy/) or [numba.cuda](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/cuda/index.html) or [numba.roc](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/roc/index.html).
    - Open questions (if the proof of concept shows that this is worth the maintenance effort):
        - How to allow control for the users to choose between default CPU implementation and optional GPU implementations (the `sklearn.set_config` context manager would probably be enough for a start) or dispatch based on the input type
        - how to allow device allocated arrays to pass through `_validate_data`, scalers...
        - ...
