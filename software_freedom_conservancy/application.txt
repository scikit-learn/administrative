*** Why does your project want to join Conservancy?  Specifically, what
    benefits do you expect to take advantage of immediately and within a
    few years?

*** Please give a detailed description of the project.
  
Scikit-learn is a Python module integrating a wide range of state-of-the-art
machine learning algorithms for medium-scale supervised and unsupervised
problems. This package focuses on bringing machine learning to non-specialists
using a general-purpose high-level language

*** What FLOSS License(s) does your project use?  Please include the
    primary license, and list other licenses for code that is included.
    (e.g., "The project as a whole is GPLv3-or-later, but about a dozen

*** Have you ever had funds held by the project, or by any individual on
    behalf of the project?  How and for what did you spend those funds?
    Are there funds remaining?  If so, who is holding them now?

Funds were held by INRIA on the behalf of the project. They were used for
organising a code sprint (travel expenses) in Granada, after a Machine
Learning conference (NIPS).

Google summer of code ?

*** Do you have any ongoing fundraising programs for your project?  How do
    they operate, and how much funding is brought in through these

    occurred in the community.

This project was started in 2007 as a Google Summer of Code project by David
Cournapeau. Later that year, Matthieu Brucher started work on this project as
part of his thesis.

In 2010 Fabian Pedregosa, Gael Varoquaux, Alexandre Gramfort and Vincent
Michel of INRIA took leadership of the project and made the first public
release, February the 1st 2010. Since then, several releases have appeard
following a ~3 month cycle, and a striving international community has been
leading the development. In two years, more than 70 developpers have
contributed to scikit-learn, each release having more than 20 contributors.

In 2011 and 2012, several Google Summer of Code projects were funded.

*** Please explain how your project is governed.  Who makes the decisions
    in the project?  How do you resolve disputes, particularly about
    non-code issues?

The project is community driven: all patches are reviewed through the Github
Pull Request interface, and all major decision are discussed on the mailing
list.

*** If your project runs on Linux-based systems, please list all the
    distributions that include your project, and what "repository area"
    the package appears in.  If you aren't packaged for any major
    distributions, please tell us why you believe your project hasn't been
    packaged yet.

- Debian
- Ubuntu

*** Does your project have any existing for-profit or non-profit
    affiliations, funding relationships, or other agreements between the
    project and/or key leaders of your project and other organizations?
    Has the project had such affiliations in the past?  Please list of all
    of them in detail and explain their nature. Even tangential
    affiliations and relationships, or potential affiliations that you
    plan to create should be included.

- INRIA is funding a full time developper on scikit-learn.
- Google has funded 1 GSoC project in 2011, and is funding 3 GSoC projects in
  2012

*** Approximately how many users does your project have, and what items
    lead you to believe your userbase is of a particular size (e.g., post
    counts to your user mailing list)?

There are between 250 and 500 emails per months.

*** Please list the names, email addresses, and affiliations (e.g.,
    employer) of key developers and major contributors.  Include both
    current and past contributors and developers.  Please include date
    ranges of when those developers/contributors were active.

    Please make this list as extensive and complete as possible.  You need
    not include every last person who sent one patch, but please include
    at least those who regularly sent patches or were/are regular
    contributors.  If you project has contributors who have been inactive
    for more than five years, you need only to list such inactive
    contributors if they made substantial contributions.
