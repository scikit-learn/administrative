### Topics
- [Issue 21993](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/21993) Change name of Triage Team
    - Goal:
        - empower people to do more
        - widen the scope (it's more than triaging)
    - The about page should probably be updated
        - We should borrow from the astropy (Maybe less categories)
    - The github permissions are attached to a group, and
    - Suggestions of names
        - Contribution coordinator
    - Decision: change name, discussion on issue
- [name=Gael]: inactive core devs / voting gridlock
    - Problem: hard to get the quorum because some people that they don't vote
    - Suggestion: make more explicit that after a month, no quorum is applicable (todo: Gael)
    - Adrin raises the point that on difficult questions, some people shy away from calling a vote
    - [name=Adrin] [SLEP 000](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/30/)
        - Vote: by opening a PR, and voting on the PR to avoid cluttering mailing list

### Need decision

- [name=Thomas]: [#21705](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21705) Saving left singular vectors (`U`) in `PCA` and friends.
    - Do not save by default for memory constraints
    - Adapt the choice on a case-to-case basis depending on how "heavy" the corresponding attribute
    - Hard (and unnecessary) to solve in the general case

### Need attention (reviews)

- [name=Jérémie]: MiniBatchNMF [#16948](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16948), started by Chiara.
    - Needs review
- [name=Olivier, Christian]: Multiclass Brier score [#22046](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22046)
    - Challenge of normalization, needs to be discussed on the issue

### Communications
- Requests for social media posts: add to [Issue #27](https://github.com/scikit-learn/administrative/issues/27)
- [name=Adrin, Lauren, Reshama]: Buffer account
    - One question is to decide which tool and who owns the account
    - And can we benefit from NumFocus' account with some kind of delegation mechanism?
- [name=Reshama, Lauren, Julien]: setting up the blog for scikit-learn
    - Create a dedicated scikit-learn/blog repo with gh-pages enabled
    - Configure the CNAME blog.scikit-learn.org to point to it (Olivier can help with this)
- [name=Julien]: I thank @reshamas and Juan Martín for [Data Umbrella's last interview](https://blog.dataumbrella.org/jmloyola-opensource-experience). To me, it nicely presents social/personal aspects of FOSS contributions.
- [name=Guillaume] Make a tutorial proposal to PyData Berlin (around inspection/explainability).
- [name=Adrin]: numpy did a nice release email [here](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/numpy-discussion@python.org/thread/R2CIEWCX6NHRH5IYCJ2QXPYAXGCHOZH4/) which is nice since they include the names of every contributor in the email, and there's a + sign beside everybody's name who's a first time contributor. It would be nice for us to do that too.

- Create a new repo called "communication" for the communication group, and a github.io "blog" for our blog
    - Todo: Gael

### For information
