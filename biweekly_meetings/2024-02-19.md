### Progress reports

- General news
  - scikit-learn 1.4.1(.post1) is out!
  - Yao Xiao granted rights as a new core contributor

- [name=Olivier]:
    - Array API with devices that do not support `float64` data
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27904
    - Investigating pytest 8.0.1 (`setup_module` is not run)
    - pydata-sphinx-theme reviews to a preview branch

- [name=Arturo]
    - a bit of mooc forum
    - some reviews (mostly dropdown stuff)

- [name=Adrin]
    - Documentation PRs with @Charlie-Xiao
    - SLEP6 work, and Stefanie's PRs
    - Validation set discussions with Christian
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28440
    - Fairlearn's maintainance against sklearn and pandas

- [name=Jérémie]
    - mostly threadpoolctl (released 3.3.0)
    - working on callbacks (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27663)

- [name=Loïc]
  - a bit of help on scikit-learn 1.4.1.post1
  - reviewed/merged some CI security PRs from Thomas. Context : running CI for GPU
    https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/24491

- [name=Gael] (reports on skrub)
    - dataframe API: giving up on that because upstream gives up -> moving to using
      dispatch mechanism

- [name=Stephanie]
    - Mainly meta-data routing PRs
        - For feature-union: found a gap in the tests

- [name=Guillaume]
    - Release 1.4.1.post1
    - Reviewed backlog from accumulated notification

- [name=Jérôme]
  - skrub [#888](https://github.com/skrub-data/skrub/pull/888) (dispatch on dataframe
    type + fixtures for testing on both pandas & polars) can be reviewed
  - reviewed [#876](https://github.com/skrub-data/skrub/pull/876) (agg joiner
    improvements + addition of multiaggjoiner)
  - worked a bit more on [#877](https://github.com/skrub-data/skrub/pull/877) (addition
    of column-wise transformations, selectors, refactoring/fixing TableVectorizer) &
    prototyping transformers that rely on expressions for lazy frames; discussions with
    Guillaume & Olivier
  - profiling of logistic regression: it seems array api may be worthwhile for lbfgs &
    newton-cg

### Discussion

- `r2_score` pb of casting, because some devices do not support float64:
    - We should put this code not in `r2_score`
    - We can have the notion of `strict` vs non `strict`
    - Maybe `r2_score` does not need float64

- validation set API:
    - internal https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28440
    - next: open an alternative issue/PR.
    - pros:
        - easier to understand what a fixed split does
    - cons:
        - having splitter is more convenient (better UX) to make it easy to enable early
          stopping.
        - data leakage only from early stopping cannot be so catastrophic(?)

- [name=Olivier] Google Meeting configuration problem: I did not see notifications to
  external people to join and could not find how to configure this.
