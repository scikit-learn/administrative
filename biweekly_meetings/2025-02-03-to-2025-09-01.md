    - It looks that any node started with a single physical core will fail
- [name=Adrin] `ClassicalMDS`: should it be its own class? https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/31322
- [name=Loïc] require 2FA for scikit-learn organization members? Bots will need to have 2FA setup and added. Do anyone know what `sklearn-wheels` bot was used for?
- [name=Guillaume] document property in sphinx

### Progress reports

- [name=Stefanie] (absent)
    - PR [MNT remove default behaviour deprecation from class_likelihood_ratios](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/31331) to adher to new solutions for issue [Make zero_division parameter consistent in the different metric](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/29048)
    - more work on PR [Investigate GaussianMixture array API support](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30777) with Loic
    - getting into PR [ENH Add support for np.nan values in SplineTransformer](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28043) again, but didn't push yet
    - reviewed PR [FIX ConvergenceWarning in plot_gpr_on_structured_data](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/31289) and some doc reviews

- [name=Olivier]
    - Some reviews for the 1.7 milestone.
    - Revived [#30041](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30041) to be able to use `pytest-run-parallel` to test free-threeding related race conditions
        - `pytest-run-parallel` was updated to fix most of the problems discovered in my previous attempt to use it on the scikit-learn test suite
        - much lower number of changes required in our test files
        - still a few issue with some thread-unsafe fixtures (but can be  tackled via configuration)
        - uses a lot of RAM when running the tests many times in parallel: not sure if this is expected or not
        - test thread-safety inspection has a ~1 min overhead when collecting the tests (before running them)
        - reported some of the remaining problems:
            - https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/pytest-run-parallel/issues?q=author%3Aogrisel
        - 148 errors (before marking compiled as safe), probably most of them caused by the use of thread-unsafe generator objects with `@pytest.mark.parametrize`
   - Explored SBOM generation for vendored dependencies `array-api-extra` and `array-api-compat` [#31343](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/31343)
       - using the [dev version of `vendoring`](https://github.com/pradyunsg/vendoring/pull/66)
       - requires seperating 100% vendored libs from partial backward compat backports instead of mixing both under `sklearn/externals/`
       - still not enough to be PEP 770 compliant: need to move the SBOM file to the right location when generating the wheel
   - Some ongoing discussions about evaluating the business case of a potential R&D colab related to robustess to training poisoning and dataset watermarking.
   - Focus this week: preparing educational material on pitfalls of using sklearn models in the context of time series forecasting.

- [name=Olivier]
    - Triaging week:
        - investigated and closed as not planned a few reports and feature requests.
        - Others seemed legit and tried to guive guidance to contributors and/or pinged other maintainers.
            - New reason to deprecate `SVC(probability=True)` [#31222](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/31222)
            - randomized `eigsh`: [#31246](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/31246)
            - volunter to expand `IterativeImputer` to support categorical features [#31219](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/31219)
    - Investigated free-threading CI build:
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/31263
        - I am surprised Cython would not complain at build time previous and why it does not fail on regular Python builds.
        - I observed a deadlock on the first commit of this PR. I enabled `faulthandler` on this build in case it happens again in the future. The deadlock problem can be investigated later in a dedicated debug PR once this one is merged.
    - Investigated and fixed unstable test for spectral clustering:
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/31262
    - Confirmed what I suspected when reviewing the temperature calibration PR:
        - Our sigmoid calibration is broken when the input is `predict_proba` values: we need to preprocess the input to extract OvR Bernoulli logits and the sigmoid calibration works really well, both for binary and multiclass classifiers:
        - Will soon open a PR, in the mean time [here is my branch](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/compare/main...ogrisel:scikit-learn:fix-always-use-logits-in-CalibratedClassifierCV).
    - Following Gaetan's progress on unbiased feature importance on random forests. Draft PR should be up soon.
    - Adapted the `plot_det` example in the `CAPCurveDisplay` PR to align with recently merged @arturo's update to this example:
        - [#28972](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28972)
    - Gave some feedback/reviews on array API PRs but not as much as I wanted.
    - Submitted a presentation on probabilistic regression for PyData Paris 2025
    - Starting to this about teaching material for time series forecasting. Will probably focus on feature engineering and evaluation of model predictions.

- [name=Gaetan]
    - Implemented two methods from the litterature to remove the cardinality bias in MDI computations for RFs, by leveraging oob samples. Available for classification and for regression with `criterion="squared_error"`.
    - adapted the test suite to use these methods. Added tests that make sure they match the methods from the papers and that they recover classical MDI on inbag samples.
    - Did a bit of memory and CPU profiling to make sure that the computational overhead is managable on large datasets compared to the cost of fitting.
    - Draft PR soon
    - Still need to choose one method over the other (e.g. find a statistical criterion that may favor one), to add support for sparse input, to implement sample weights

      unbiased MDI computation with the help of out-of-bags data point.
      - naively computing MDI on test data-point is still biased towards higher cardinality features.
      - 2 methods implement some form of cross-MDI that take the class frequencies of in-bag and out-of-bag datapoints at each node of the trees to estimate unbiased alternative to MDIs that should still be cheap enough to compute.
      - draft PR should be open soon to share findings.

    - that is a possibility, either a pre-commit or an additional linter step like `black`/`ruff`/`mypy`, or both. Some content are generated (rst from .py examples, `.rst.template`) so this may catch only a subset of issues, probably good enough still

    - a lot of doc reviews

- [name=Olivier]
    - First pass of review on default policy `sample_weight` meta-data routing
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30946
        - are `sample_weight` special or should we always request all metadata?
            - if yes, this could be a justification to release scikit-learn 2.0 if this causes breaking changes?
            - would require to study impact on downstream libraries to make a decision
    - Investigated with Antoine why decision trees do not pass the `sample_weight` repetition equivalence tests
        - rounding errors cause different choices of splits with near-tied impurity improvements when running the stochastic tests
        - rounding errors cause small but non-uniform offsets in leaf values in shallow trees (10 to 100x machine epsilon)
        - need to follow-up with opening issues to document the bias induced by the current code when the data leads to (exact or near) tied splits
            - current handling of tied splits leads to hard to understand inductive bias when inspecting the prediction function of learned decision trees
        - potential solution would involve randomized near-tie breaking in trees and then our stochastic test sample_weight equivalence tests should pass
        - alternatively we would need to change the way we write the `sample_weight` equivalence tests.
    - A few reviews to get loky 3.5.0 out.
    - Science: I read the [TabPFNv2 paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08328-6) and now reading the [TabICL preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05564).

### Discussion points

- Bump to Python 3.10 opinions are roughly split between plan 1 (oldest minor `X.Y` with Python 3.10 wheels) plan 2 (oldest bugfix `X.Y.Z` with Python 3.10 wheels) and "both are fine". https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30895
- Moving meta-data routing (sample weights) to more mandatory
    - The challenge is when we add metadata routing to something, eg a scoring, in which case it leads to a change in statistical behavior
- [name=Guillaume] `SearchCV`:
    - I'm under the impression that we should improve the validation curve
    - Still thinking about the parallel coordinate plot (`skrub` does some stuff in this area (wip))

### Discussion points

- [name=Olivier] Wikipedia editing
- [name=Adrin] balancing priorities, comms with the outside, expectations from other maintainers
- [name=Olivier] inconsistent handling of location in `joblib.Memory`
- [name=Gael] what can we learn / borrow from the numpy review process? How do we change?
    - One good reviewer sufficient for merge
        - Suggestion: define what need two reviews (eg no changelog => 1 review sufficient; new API => 2 reviews needed). Need more trust of reviewer
    - Maybe introducing a time boundary after which only one maintainer is allowed to merge.
    - PR triaging, close more PR
        - Revived triaging meeting to triage PR and close some to help focus attention

        ```
        ✅ 19 passed the deterministic test
        ❌ 4 failed the deterministic test
        ✅ 14 passed the statistical test

    - Slight revamp of the C-index metric
    - Enhance the accuracy in time

### Discussion points

- [name=Guillaume] I confirm that Kagi search engine looks to have the same behaviour than Google and point out to 1.6.1

- [name=Loïc] Stefanie's Github search issue: probably an alternative way to do what you want. Likely due to us switching to "new-style issues" (or whatever it is called with sub-issues)

- [name=Loïc] JupyterLab/JupyterLite issue, do you have a way to reproduce?

- [name=Arturo] JupyterLite crash on the scikit-learn.org/stable examples.
    - error in the JS console of firefox when running the first cell of an example with import statements `TypeError: _query_package() got multiple values for argument 'index_urls'`
