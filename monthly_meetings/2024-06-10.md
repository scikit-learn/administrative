        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29150
    - Reviewed and beta-tested / refined the new CUDA GPU CI github workflow:
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/main/.github/workflows/cuda-gpu-ci.yml
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29130
    - Getting started pair programming session with Emily Chen
    - Bunch of reviews on all open Array API PRs
    - Starting triage week (mostly updating/fixing Build/CI bot issues so far)

- [name=Arturo]
    - Thresholds in DET curve [#29151](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29151)
    - Quantile loss in user guide on HGBT regression [#29063](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29063)
    - A bit of mooc [#780](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/780)

- [name=Jérôme]
    - `skrub` `TableVectorizer` PR merged
    - follow-ups: simplifying `GapEncoder`, `MinHashEncoder`
    - fixing missing value handling in `GapEncoder` & `MinHashEncoder`
    - adding a `make_tabular_pipeline` helper to easily build a simple but reasonable supervised estimator
    - `RidgeCV` array api: should be running but in small timing experiments it seems slow, need to investigate

- [name=Jérémie]
    - PR adding `writeable` param to `check_array` ready for review: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29018
    Fixes a 1.5.0 regression so worth putting in 1.5.1 imo.
    - Callback base infra + ProgressBar based on discussions from drafting meeting ready for review: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28760


### Discussion points

- [name=Adrin]
    - Finding sponsors specific to GPU CI costs?
    - Did we backport fix on ML model map?
        - backport ASAP to avoid having more people open issues on this
- [name=Guillaume]
    - scikit-learn 1.5.1 timeline
        - blocker is probably: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29018
        - random dead-lock at import: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/29145
