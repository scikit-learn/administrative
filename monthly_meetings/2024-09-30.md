### Updates

- [name=Guillaume] Start of the CZI grant (via NumFOCUS)
    - https://blog.scikit-learn.org/funding/czi-eoss6-announcement/
    - Lucy will contribute for the next two years
    - Start setting up one or more internship(s)
        - Discussion around topic and location of the mentee(s)


### Topics

- [name=Olivier] scikit-learn 1.5.2 was released (thanks!)
    - But we decided not to release CPython 3.13 wheels for that release to keep it lean, but we should probably do ASAP:
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/29973
    - This involves backporting some CI config to the `1.5.X` branch.
    - We probably don't need to change anything in the existing 1.5.2 release but only manually upload the new files?
    - [name=Guillaume] I'm going to try to take care of it.
- [name=Guillaume] Check splits in cross-validation
    -  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/29558
    -  there are three cases where this occurs:
        -  a. cross-validation inside an estimator (e.g. `RFECV`)
        -  b. check equivalence between fitting with weighted data points and repeated data points in cases where some classes only have zero-weight/repetition data points
        -  c. meta-estimator to turn a regression into a multiclass problem via binning to be able to do probablistic regression
    -  maybe a solution is to add public API that allows the caller to pass the known list of all classes
        -  this way estimators can add a column of zeros to predict_proba/predict for any missing classes
- [name=Omar] Array-API for functions whose implementations currently need Cython (or any CPU only implementation):
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29881
    - pairwise distance -> scipy distance that is not going to support Array-API
    - currently convert the array explicitely to NumPy before to do the computation
    - introduce a config option: `array_api_allow_numpy_fallback`? Ternary valued: `True`, `False`, `"warn"`? (whenever `_convert_to_numpy`).
- [name=Guillaume] Revisit the topic of lazy loading (when importing modules):
    - Latest discussion in: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26440
        - Closed in favor of: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29793
    - Endorsing SPEC1 independently: https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0001/
        - Good practice when import overhead exists: https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0001/#ecosystem-adoption
    - Do we really want to typical change the "import style" of scikit-learn users?
        - There should be one (advertised) way to do it.
    - `__getattr__` magic can be confusing.
- [name=Guillaume] Topic around `random_state`
    - Solving the ambuiguities in `scikit-learn` via the SLEP022: https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/88
    - Recommendation via the SPEC7: https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0007/

### Need attention/decision

- [name=Olivier] More sensitive `sample_weight` common test / estimator check:
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29818
  - Checks general equivalence between weighting and repeating training data points (zero weight == dropping data point is a special case of this rule).
  - Discovered new bugs, now tracked in the https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/16298 meta-issue.
  - This equivalence should serve as a guideline to design default routing logic for `sample_weight`:
      - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/26179
