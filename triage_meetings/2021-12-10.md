## PRs or Issues that Need Attention

## Topics

- **Close?** [Issues and PRs that might be closed](https://github.com/cmarmo/scikit-learn/projects/4#column-17062112) (Chiara) What about having a "Close?" Label for this case?
    - Needs second opinion
    - amueller: Maybe "Triage Close" is more clear?
    - Ogrisel: The person labeling the issue or PR should also add a comment explaining why they think we might want to "close?" so it should be sufficiently clear to the person opening the PR/issue (amueller agreed)
- **How to structure this meeting?**
    - How often?
        - Every two weeks == Less to time passed which should have less topics to discus thus only needing ~30 minutes each time?
    - Alterating between two time slots?
        - 16:30 UTC == Morning for Andy, mid afternoon for Europe
        - 21:30 UTC == Morning for Joel, nighttime for Europe
    - Which platform?
        - Discord: we want to break out into separate discussions
        - **Google meet**: most people know how to use it (Need a host to be there)
    - For each meeting, a few modules will be selected to focus on for triaging, but any issue is still open for discussion.
        - Focus on "Bug - triage" first
- **Triaging itself:** [Labeling](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/wiki/labels)
    - Two axis:
        - How impactful is the task?
            - **Blocking**: Need to be in the next upcomming release. (likely a bug fix)
            - **High Priority**: One of the next two major release
            - **Low Priority**: No timeline (We only used this two times)
            - Remove **Low Priority**? everything without a priority level is by default low and has no timeline.
        - How easy is the task?
            - Super Easy (Good first issue) requires instructions
            - Easy (Rare)
            - Moderate (Hard to judge)
            - Hard (Most issues)
    - What to triage?
        - New features request be triaged too?
        - "Needs Triage" label to remove when triaged
    - Labels for PR workflow
        - When to use?
            - "Needs Response" - Response from contributor?
            - "Needs work" ???
        - New Label:
            - "Needs Decision - Inclusion" ?
            - "Needs Decision - API" ?
            - "Needs Decision - Compat" ?
        - "Superseded" - Should we close? Close if there is another PR.
        - "Stalled" - Automate the labeling of Stalled? (But never close)
        - Is `[MRG+1]` or `[MRG]` useful anymore?
            - Mostly for email filters?
            - Not used anymore: should update the documentation to not mention that anymore?
    - GitHub [Codeowners](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners)?
        - Not required to review
        - Makes it easier to focus based on your interest
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/wiki/Available-reviewers
        - **No codeowners** for now.
- New Labels:
    - "Needs Reproducible Code" label
    - We also need a guide to help bug reporter how to craft such minimal reproducible code examples: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/21945
- (Thomas) I am planning to go through all issues and PRs and labeling them

## Topic ideas (If time permits)
- Prioritizing issues and pull requests for the next bug fix release (`1.0.2`)
- Prioritizing issues and pull requests for the next major release (`1.1`)
