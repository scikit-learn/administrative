# Scikit-learn Monthly Developer meeting
### July 25 2022 @ 15 UTC

When you add an entry, please add you name next to it.

### Topics
- [name=Thomas] Vote on [SLEP018](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/72): Pandas output for Transformers
- [name=Julien] Welcoming Franck, who joined the team at INRIA, working on the partnership with Intel and on performance generally. Some pointers:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/22438
- [name=Julien] [EuroScipy 2022 @ Basel](https://www.euroscipy.org/2022/index.html), Aug. 29 - Sep. 2
    - 9 from INRIA + other maintainers in Europe will join

### Need decision
- [name=Thomas] Rethink tags? [#22606](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22606)
    - Related: Replacing [estimator_type](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17806) with a tag is harder for third party estimators that do not depend on scikit-learn [is that because of the implementation details of tags (AM)]
    - sktime and how they [use tags](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/4164639e1c521b112711c045d0f7e63013c1e4eb/sktime/base/_base.py#L283).
    - Talking to 3rd-party libraries that depend on scikit-learn but inherit from BaseEstimator might be interesting (XGBoost?)
        - XGBoost inherits from [BaseEstimator](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/f93a727869bdf93c8efa086aecd5865340754f43/python-package/xgboost/compat.py#L48)

### Need attention (reviews)
- [name=Meekail Zain] [HDBSCAN](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22616)
  > [name=Julien] That's somewhere on my list. :)
- [name=Thomas] `FunctionTransformer` storing `feature_names_in_` + `n_features_in_` regardless of `validate` parameter:  [#23993](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23993)
- `random_state` support for Generators [#23962](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23962) by Benjamin

### Action items
- `n_features_out` SLEP013, reject
- SLEP012 leave open

### Next meeting date and chair person
- Try For Aug 29 for a NA + Austraila time slot, if not move to September 5
