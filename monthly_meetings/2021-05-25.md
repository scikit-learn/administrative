### Need decision
- [PR#16449](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16449) Sample weights for ElasticNetCV (Christian)

  It introduces a new parameter `use_weights_in_cv` in order to control the score aggretation over cv splits:
  - `np.mean(scores)` or
  - `np.average(scores, weight=sum_of_sample_weights_of_folds)`

  **Decision** Whether or not this choice is made should not make a big difference (hopefully), because the weights should be similar across the folds.
  Hence we will lean to taking the non weighted mean, for reasons of consistency of with the rest of the model (GridSearchCV)
- [Issue#19627](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/19627) PolynomialFeatures always generates all combinations with degree less than the
  degree parameter (Christian)

  We often want `AB` and not `A, B, AB`.
  Options:
  1. Introduce `min_degree` and `max_degree`. What is then the meaning of `interaction_only=True`?
  2. Clearify / Change behavior of current `interaction_only=True`. (On top, the currecnt docstring of `interaction_only` is misleading.)
  3. New transformer `InteractionTransformer` (for which categorical support might be simpler to implement...) 

  **Decision** clarify the purpose of `interaction_only` but don't change its behavior. Long term: patsy-like functionality

### Need attention (review)


### General topics
- Reorganize meeting announcements and reminders (eg define the person in charge each time for the next meeting) (Chiara)
    - Sending meeting reminders and updating **scikit-learn/administrative** repo with meeting notes
    - **Suggestion**: Round robin between main actors
- Announcement: [Fujitsu sprint](https://www.fujitsu.com/jp/group/labs/en/about/resources/article/202104-devsprint.html) (May 27-28) if some core-devs are available for reviewing. (Chiara)
- Steps forward with GAMS (Thomas)
    - Work on a PR for spline based GAMs.
    - Concurrently improve tree based GAMS [PR#19914](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19914) and benchmark it with spline based GAMS.
- Added `array_out='pandas'` as a kwarg to `transform` for the preprocessing module [PR#20100](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20100) (Thomas)
    - Meta-estimators such as pipeline would need `transform_kwargs` to route the metadata (This is one of the reasons Thomas is working on SLEP006)
    - Revisit the idea of turning the transform_kwargs to an init params, similar to `sparse_out`.
    - Additional constructor parameters suggests we might want to consider "parameter overload" and how to present parameters in documentation. Joel has a PR for annotating parameters: [PR#17929](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17929).
- [SLEP006](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/55) is ready for another round of reviews. [rendered version](https://thomasjpfan.github.io/enhancement_proposals/slep006/proposal.html) (Thomas)
    - Draft implementation needs to be updated.
- [Issue#19333](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/19333) Track SLEP10: Add `n_features_in_` to all modules (Christian)
  In particular meta-estimators are remaining ones.
- Part of the team at Inria is involved in running a [MOOC on scikit-learn](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/en/courses/machine-learning-python-scikit-learn/) that is now running online (material hosted at: https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc)
