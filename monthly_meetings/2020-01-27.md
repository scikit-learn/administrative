### Development

#### SLEP:



- [#16112](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16112) -
  `n_features_in_` SLEP implementation - **need reviews**
- [#16079](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16079) - `sample
  props` SLEP implementation - candidate implementation
- [#15](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/15)
  `resampler` SLEP -> update based on review
- `n_feature_out_` SLEP -> need to be drafted




- Fast PDPs for trees and forests
  [#15864](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/15864)
- Monotonic constraints for Hist-GBDTs
  [#15582](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/15582)

- Gower distances
  [#9555](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/9555)
- reviewing encoder enhancements and work towards categorical dtype by
  @thomasjpfan.

- vendor vs add dependency on threadpoolctl
  ([#14980](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/14980))? For now
  only used in #11950. If consider as dependency, required to make the package
  available through different source (conda-forge and pip). Vendering -> update
  via patch releases? `threadpoolctl` could make sense to be part of `numpy` or
  `scipy`?

- compile with different compilers on azure ? (related to
  [#16193](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16193)). Shall we
  include ICC in a build on Azure? Via a CRON job?

- Move some of the SLEP further.
- Parallelization or optimization of algorithms (SVC, CD)

- [#16155](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/16155) - needs
  decisions on boston housing and B feature, we need to continue and finish the
  dicsussion there.
- [#16061](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16061) - Plot
  decision boundary
- [#15702](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/15702) - Cleaner
  interface for using the same plotting function on the same axis.
- [#16197](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16197) - Adding
  "take" for automation

- Maintenance work on cloudpickle / loky / joblib

Issues to discuss:

### Other points:

* follow-up with partners of the scikit-learn @ Inria foundation -> update
  roadmap
* Berlin sprint [beginner's
  workshop](https://github.com/scikit-learn-fondation/ParisSprintJanuary2020/blob/master/workshop.md)
* tutorial scikit-learn at scipy
* welcoming community: language on pull requests; "community call" reminders
  should be said out, to be inclusive.

### Bug fix release 0.22.2

* single regression for which user can easily downgrade. Waiting for additional
  fixes to consider a release.
