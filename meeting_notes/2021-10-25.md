### Fun topics
- (Reshama) Introduce Lauren Burke
    - announcing release
    - twitter, linkedin, and youtube permissions
    - Coordinate announcements on gitter
    - Another types of media? Videos?
    - **ACTION:** Meeting with Reshama, Olivier, and Lauren (mid-November)
    - Facebook page: getting ownership of the FB page is not possible, we will need to start our own page.
        - (Lauren) We may be able to create our own page and then claim this page as a duplicate - esp. since it has not been active since January 2019.

- (Guillaume) Maybe release 1.0.1
    - Need announcement on all social media apart of the mailing list
- (adrin) sample props [latest PR](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21284)
    - There's progress, we need to keep working on a few pieces.

### Need decision

- (christian) [#4668](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/4668) LinearModelCV objects compute mse for cross-validation but score gives r2:
  Can we resolve this old issue?
  - resolution is to close the issue as WONTFIX
  - we can get to passing a string to `.score` later.
- (christian) [#19148](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/19148) Issue for interaction constraints for HGBT:
  As Andy pointed out, there is little scientific references to justify this new feature. I see 3 good reasons:
  1. It is not a new estimator, just an extension to an existing one, so the barrier might be lower.
  2. LightGBM and XGBoost have it. This is a new kind of argument for new features.
  3. From a practitioner's point of view, this is an important must have.
  4. Have user options such as "univariate" for a better UI
- (christian) [#21170](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/21170) Feature importance for linear models.
  Let's discuss another time.
    - Delay to next dev meeting
- (Guillaume) admin -> vote/accept SLEP007
    - Make a vote on a PR (with a link sent on the Mailing List)

### Need attention (reviews)

 - (Julien) [#20254](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20254) ENH Private Cython Submodule for Reduction over Pairwise Distances
    - removed patches to reduced the PR by 1000 lines
        - removed ±1000 lines to only have the infrastructure for KNN search
        - so now "only about" +2500/-400 lines are to review
        - will add some more tests
    - follow-up PRs to come for:
        - Radius Neighborhood
        - {sparse, dense}² datasets pairs

### General topics
- (Adrin): Sync comms
    - Make use of the public scikit-learn discord server
- Data Umbrella AMEA Sprint last WE:
    - many new contributors and returning contributors from previous sprints (~35 attendees in total),
    - many PRs still to review,
    - contributors address feedback quickly.
- (Roman) Process to repond to CVEs?
    - Recent CVE for [#18891](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/18891#issuecomment-731714716)
    - https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-23349/product_id-86232/Scikit-learn-Scikit-learn.html
- Next office hours:  Friday, Oct 29 at 11am ET (15:00 UTC)
    - Thomas: to send reminder to mailing list
    - Reshama: to send reminder to sprint folks
