# July 27 2020 -- Scikit-learn dev meeting

### Need decision

* (Guillaume) add copy parameter to get_scorer [#17962](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17962)

  * Needed to avoid caveat (eg in roc_auc)
  * It will switch the default behavior. We should consider this as a bug, and hence bypass our deprecation cycle. But we should mark this clearly as a changed behavior in the release notes.
    
* (Joel) categorising parameters in docstrings, e.g. as control vs tuning vs resources [#17929](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17929)

  * Adding well-formated labels in the parameters docstrings using restructured text constructs
  * Tuning parameters, control parameters, resource parameters
  * The difference between tuning and control parameters is “subttle”
  * **Suggestion is to not label every parameter and focus on the most important one**
  * The difficulty is in choosing how to label, while there is consensus on the technical solution
  * Conclusion: focus on a **“tune me” label** for the most important parameter

### Need attention (review)

* (Nicolas) Strict mode for check_estimator: [#17361](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17361): not controversial. Please review.
* (Nicolas) Revamp of cross-decomposition module. Mostly docs and fixes: [#17095](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17095): cleanup, not controversial.
* (Thomas) Python typing for parameters [#17799](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17799):

  * Uses the typing extension module, which is included Python 3.8, but not before
  * Difficult to read for human being, and a roadblock to new users
  * General (but weak) consensus on the fact that we need to provide typing information
  * Suggestion to focus on the simpler types (eg avoiding ranges)

* (Thomas) Target or Impact encoder [#17323](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17323)

  * Name “ImpactEncoder”, because “TargetEncoder” gives the impression that we are encoding the Target.
  * Choice of smoothing parameter based on published benchmark

* (Jérémie) ASV benchmarks [#17026](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17026): Needs review
* (Guillaume) Implementation of weighted percentile [#17768](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17768)

  * Limited interpolation in weighted percentile, leads to inconsistent behavior in the Gradient boosting
  * Depending on the choice, we might not have equivalence between repeated samples and the weights

### General topics

* (Joel) Release of 0.23.2: August?

  * Olivier can help up to Aug 12th
  * TODO The countvectorizer issue still needs attention [#17939](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/17939)
  * PRs in the [milestone](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/milestone/40) need review

* (Joel) Uptake and visibility of display=‘diagram’

  * Visibility will improve with further teaching materials
  * Challenge to convey to the user the link to the constructor and the parameters
  * One option is to have the expanded view when there is only one estimator

* (Andy) logging vs multiprocessing

  * We will not be robust to all computing environments (which is fine)
  * The callback mechanism is important to put estimators in production

* (Andy) Column name consistency [#17407](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17407)

  * Checking that the column names are the same at fit/transform/predict

* (Olivier) EuroPython sprint feedback
* (Olivier) ARM64 support progress report:

  * Tree pickling + manual docker debugging [#17644](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17644)
  * CI [#17996](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17996)
  * Good news: to debug ARM is easier than it used to be, thanks to docker + qemu

* (Joel) factory-style construction of composite estimators: who wants to write a slep? [#16301](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/16301)

### Contributors

* (Venkat) Feedback on this feature request [#18009](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/18009)

  * Just like plot_tree for decision tree, can we have a feature for plot_topics for LDA, PCA, NMF, etc.
  * Question of scope: such a feature probably needs to be adapted to a given modality (text, image, …)
  * Conclusion: probably out of scope
