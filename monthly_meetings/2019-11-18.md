## 0.22 Release
- Release dates: proposed 29 November 2019
- RC2? The wheels are already on wheels.scipy.org for RC1, but they won't work
  on pypi
- Someone need to use Joel's script to rearrange what's new. No, someone should
  work out if it's still relevant at all...
- [#15583](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/15583) LR
  preconditionning
  - move to 0.23
  - better convergence warning
  - point to liblinear solver in the warning. @ogrisel improves the message.
  
- [#15618](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/15618) 3.8.
  @thomasjpfan is testing it. Needs a fix!
- [#13511](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/13511) libsvm
  liblinear rng. We merge it.
- Easy late fix

## Active discussion
- maybe settle down on files we want to include in the package

  similarity coefficient. The PR has moved very slowly, it's getting close to
  using another reviewer. Since it mixes categorical and numberical, there are
  issues where we need to resolve. It demands pre-scaling the numerical
  features, i.e. full dataset statistics are needed (like covariance in
  mahalanobis), but this is first metric implemented in scikit-learn rather
  than scipy that needs such functionality. There are quite a few points which
  require some attention.
- Call for a vote on [n_features_in
  SLEP](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/22) after
  release
- `logistic.py` haunts Nicolas's dreams
- Discuss the behavior we want for encoders handling of pd.Categorical
- Consistency between XYZ and plot_XYZ, i.e., plot_XYZ should plot the output
  of XYZ, it should not provide additional features.
  - confusion_matrix

- Guillaume's focus
  * Finish-up some works UX with the PDP
  * Go back on the SLEP005
  * Examples for inspection regarding linear models
  * Advance examples in the inspection module
  * Continue a couple of enhancement for the PDP (categorical variable
    support + bootstrapping)
  * Take-over/Review work for `BalancedRandomForest` and
    `BalancedBaggingClassifier`
- Should named array deal with categorical features? / Adrin's slep
- Jeremie's focus
  - threadpoolctl to make kmeans new implem (#11950) perfectly safe to use.

## Orga/Culture
- Meeting notes on a separate repo? @adrin creates that
- Discussions around
  [#15355](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/15355) can be much
  shorter - we as a team agree that we should be faster/nicer in these cases.
  Take a risk analysis of the PR into account when reviewing and deciding to
  pospone merge or merge fast. Also decide faster.
- scikit-learn 10 year anniversary (decentralized) sprint in February?
  - Decentralized/small in Feb. @adrin starts the email thread
  - In person maintainers in June
  
- scikit-learn twitter account "edit"-flow
  - the permission will be shared among some people
  - do drafts and edit before sending
- Should we start using github actions? @thomasjpfan is on top of it
  - it can change labels, effectively letting users set labels.
  - also time based label setting
  - automatically claiming based on a comment, etc.
  - Ideas about automation
    - The bot used by Python:
      [cpython#16985](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/16985) can be
      useful. It allo
    - Auto updating labels on issues if it has a PR that fixes it.
    - Label PR as stalled if there was not actively for ~2 months.
- Intel's request, they're done with the changes, we should discuss on the PR.
  - document that the intel's channel doesn't monkeypatch by default.
  - question is that if it's possible that distributors patch into `__init__`.
    There's already a PR (#15570).
