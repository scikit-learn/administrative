# Scikit-learn Monthly Developer meeting

### July 31 2023

- [name=Julien Jerphanion] Comply with SPEC 0
    - Current minimum version:
        - Python (>= 3.8)
        - NumPy (>= 1.17.3)
        - SciPy (>= 1.5.0)
    - Reasons to comply (see also [the motivation for SPEC 0](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0000/#motivation)):
        - use SciPy's and NumPy's latest changes, removing branching based on their versions at runtime (remove maintainance cost)
        - provide public release schedule, helping downstream libraries
        - a prelimary to get ride of SciPy sparse matrices
        - encourage users to update their environment, benefiting their work
    - Reasons not to comply:
        - allow scikit-learn to be used in more environment
        - less flexibility if scikit-learn has to follow a release schedule
    - Decision: should we do a vote on the mailing list?
