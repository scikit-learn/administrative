### Updates

- [name=Guillaume] Release 1.3.1
    - ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
- [name=Olivier] Currently updating the scikit-learn MOOC at Inria to be open in "self-paced" mode from November 8th:
    - https://www.fun-mooc.fr/en/courses/machine-learning-python-scikit-learn/
    - Material is developed online at:
        - https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc
        - Refactored module on linear models

### Topics

- [name=Guillaume] Schedule for release 1.4
    - Target early November?
        - RC in the beginning of November
        - 1.4.1 bugfix early December
    - Decide remaining priorities for this release
        - [name=Gael] [The enhanced html display for estimators](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26616)
        - [name=Guillaume] [TunedThresholdClassifier](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26120)
        - [name=Christian] [ENH add feature subsampling per split for HGBT](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27139)?
- [name=Guillaume] Creation of a recurrent contributors team
    - Objective: give more credits to recurring contributors on the [about.html page](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/about.html)
    - Automatic generation of a list based on commit history
        - Downside: no systematic personal contact between the core and the recurrent team
        - how to deal with gaming/spam?
            - maybe address in v1 via labelling or blacklisting?
        - do we need to use a definition that is broader than "commits"?
            - for example people helping out in issues or the "discussions" part of GitHub
                - maybe doesn't happen so much in scikit-learn?
        - Move forward with imperfect solution and possibly adjust if needed
- [name=Meekail] Should we consider another user survey to get some concrete data on user interests, preferences, and priorities?
    - start drafting a list of questions on hackmd

### Need decision

- [name=Christian] Choice of the name of a constructor parameter
    - PR: [ENH add feature subsampling per split for HGBT](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27139)?
    - related issue https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/27347
    - Option: use `max_features` as name but only allow floating point (0.-1.) input at this time. This would get the feature into v1.4 with the option of adding integers in the future.

### Need attention (reviews)

- [name=Olivier] fix random CI failures related to `test_pairwise_argkmin` with a different data seeds/platforms:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27281
        - [name=Guillaume] I'll be reviewing this one
- [name=LoÃ¯c] Python 3.12 wheels
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27027
    - do we want Python 3.12 wheels for scikit-learn 1.3.1? Python 3.12 scheduled release is in one week (October 2).
        - [name=Tim] [name=Guillaume] [name=Olivier] [name=Gael] votes yes
- [name=LoÃ¯c] Add a CI build to run test suite inside Pyodide
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27346
- [name=Guillaume] [TunedThresholdClassifier](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26120)
    - Fairlearn estimator: https://fairlearn.org/v0.9/api_reference/generated/fairlearn.postprocessing.ThresholdOptimizer.html
    - fairlearn paper: https://jmlr.org/papers/v24/23-0389.html
