# *February 22nd 2021*
### Need decision
- Adrin, Alex, Christian, Joel: [Vote](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/52) on [SLEP006](https://scikit-learn-enhancement-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/slep006/proposal.html) with partial implementation in [PR #16079](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16079)
    - Sample props / meta data in pipelines
    - SLEP finished and draft PR
    - Everyone needs to prioritize reading this and voting on it
    - Suggestion to have a fallback for when the new method is present
        - By default nothing is passed without this method
        - Asking for meta-data that cannot be routed will raise an error
- Christian: [#18248](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/18248) RFC Consistent options/names for loss and criterion
  - There seems to be a consensus for `"squared_error"` and `"absolute_error"`.
  - PR [#19310](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19310) for "squared_error" 

### Need attention (review)
- Christian: [PR #19333](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/19333) Track SLEP10 (`n_features_in_`)
    - Needs review
- Christian: Have a look at benchmarks in [PR #19089](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19089) Common loss module for logistic regression and hgbt.
    - Executive summary: no strong drawback from a computational standpoint and some benefits
- Christian: Placeholder for some more "milestone 1.0" issues and PRs?
    - Next release will be 1.0 release; there are some issues and PRs tagged with it.  Will there be more?
- Olivier: StandardScaler on near-constant features can lead to very large values with sample weights [PR #19527](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19527)
    - Can happen for categories almost always present

### General topics

- Roman: Next steps for callbacks / progress bars (and logging) [PR #16925](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16925)?
    - Explore, because it will be on a case by case
- Roman: General discussion about our strategy for attracting new repeated contributors. % of repeated contributors following sprints? Other possible actions.
    - Effort on qualifying the issues:
        - Understanding why the user has a problem before starting to address it
- Data Umbrella feedback:
    - How to help review a pull-request
    - How to help reviewing if bug reports can be reproduced and qualified to produce an analysis about what should be done.
    - How to qualify a bug report? To know whether or not this is a bug report

**Next meeting**: 29th of March
