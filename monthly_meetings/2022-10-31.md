# Scikit-learn Monthly Developer meeting
### Oct 31 @ 15:00 UTC

When you add an entry, please add you name next to it.

### Topics

- [name=Julien] Chair person rotation
    - requires Google "pro" account to generate meeting links for more than 1h
    - Decision: leave it as is, still volunteers with Google "Pro" account are welcome!
- [name=Adrin] Mentorship program pilot with NumFocus
    - Adrin, Andreas, Guillaume are open to mentoring
- [name=Adrin] Bitergia dashboards
    - Do we have concerns?
        - Privacy, etc.
    - Do we have wishes? 
    - 8th November is the demo meeting
- [name=Julien] [SLEP019: Governance Update - Recognizing Contributions Beyond Code](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/74)
    - Vote ends in 11 days from now (Friday, 11 November 2022 16:00 UTC+0)
    - Latest changes were about better rewording and precising changes
    - Last proposal from [@noatamir](noatamir): [renaming Technical Committee (TC) to Steering Committee or Steering Council (SC)](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/74#issuecomment-1295078486)
        - SciPy also has a [Steering Council](https://scipy.org/about/)
    - Discussions:
        - extending the scope of TC to SC makes sense regarding project organisation and governance generally (it is already the case for interaction with NumFocus for instance)
        - some reported that the the period of vote is too short and the SLEP is still being reworded: we need more time. To this end, we can wait for the end of the vote and re-do another one once the SLEP has been properly worded.
- [name=Olivier] `[UX]` Try to leverage the feature names in constructor parameters before the 1.2 release?
    - `monotonic_cst` in a follow-up PR to [#13649](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/13649) 
    - `interaction_cst`
    - `categorical` variables for HGBDT models
    - other? => PDP
- [name=Olivier] Release highlights for 1.2?
    - Thomas has started a PR for release highlights
- [name=Olivier] FYI: There was a [security report](https://huntr.dev/bounties/309725a2-bfc9-4ef3-a4c1-360a9f6b890b/) but it does not impact library code, only code snippets in the doc so we decided we did to backport the [fix](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24617) as it can wait for 1.2.
- [name=Andreas] [SLEP 17](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/67/files) Clone Protocol [PR](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24568). Ready to vote?
    - Andy to merge and call for a vote
- [name=Guillaume] Revive the office hours?
    - 16th and 30th November 5pm CEST

### Need decision
 - `TimeSeriesSplit` [23780](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23780) vs [24589](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24589)
    - [23780](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23780) addresses the following by introducing `max_train_size` and `test_size` with `n_splits="walk_forward"`, however the PR is stale and needs hefty changes to get operational:
       - [22523](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/22523) (rolling window/walk forward)
    - [24589](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24589) addresses the above in addition to the following and is good to go after minimal changes, however it does so by introducing an additional class:
       - [24243](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/24243) (time series split with skip in addition to gap, increasing the test set shifting amount from one test set to a test set plus skip)
       - [23923](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/23923) (sets the number of training samples in the first window to min_train_size, reducing cross validation scoring noise introduced when first folds do not have enough training data)

### Need attention (reviews)
- [name=Kshitij] Implement max recall at K precision and max precision at K recall [24671](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24671)
    - [name=Guillaume] I will have to look at this PR since I looked at the previous abandonned PR.
- [name=Olivier] Euclidean Sparse-sparse support for Cython implementation of pairwise + reduction [#24556](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24556)
- [name=Olivier] `solver="newton-cholesky"` for binary (and OvR) `LogisticRegression` [#24767](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24767)
    - [name=Julien] I will review this PR.
- [name=Guillaume] Build infrastructure
    - Move away from distutils [24563](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24563)
    - Adding meson as in other projects, e.g.:
        - [scikit-image](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/6536)
        - [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/14847)
    - [name=Julien] I will review this PR.

### Action items

- [name=Guillaume] Will check and raise an issue if `scikit-learn-intelx` is blocking the update of `scikit-learn` on the Anaconda default channel.

### Next meeting date and chair person
